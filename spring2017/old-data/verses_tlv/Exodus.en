1:1  who came into Egypt with Jacob, each man with his family: 
1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah; 
1:3 Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin; 
1:4 Dan, Naphtali, Gad and Asher. 
1:5 The souls that came out of the line of Jacob numbered 70 in all, while Joseph was already in Egypt. 
1:6 Then Joseph died, as did all his brothers and all that generation. 
1:7  were fruitful, increased abundantly, multiplied and grew extremely numerous—so the land was filled with them. 
1:8 Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. 
1:9  are too numerous and too powerful for us. 
1:10 Come, we must deal shrewdly with them, or else they will grow even more numerous, so that if war breaks out, they may join our enemies, fight against us, and then escape from the land.” 
1:11 So they set slave masters over them to afflict them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Raamses as storage cities for Pharaoh. 
1:12 . 
1:13 They worked them harshly, 
1:14 and made their lives bitter with hard labor with mortar and brick, doing all sorts of work in the fields. In all their labors they worked them with cruelty. 
1:15 Moreover the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah, 
1:16 and said, “When you help the Hebrew women during childbirth, look at the sex. If it’s a son, then kill him, but if it’s a daughter, she may live.” 
1:17 Yet the midwives feared God, so they did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let the boys live. 
1:18 So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this—let the boys live?” 
1:19 The midwives told Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women. They are like animals, and give birth before the midwife comes to them.” 
1:20 So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied, growing very numerous. 
1:21 Because the midwives feared God, He gave them families of their own. 
1:22 But Pharaoh charged all his people saying, “You are to cast every son that is born into the river, but let every daughter live.”
2:1 Now a man from the house of Levi took as his wife a daughter of Levi. 
2:2 The woman conceived and gave birth to a son. Now when she saw that he was delightful, she hid him for three months. 
2:3 But when she could no longer hide him, she took a basket of papyrus reeds, coated it with tar and pitch, put the child inside, and laid it in the reeds by the bank of the Nile. 
2:4 His sister stood off at a distance to see what would happen to him. 
2:5 Then the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe, while her maidens walked along by the riverside. When she saw the basket among the reeds, she sent her handmaiden to fetch it. 
2:6 When she opened it, she saw the child—look, a baby boy crying! She had compassion on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrew children.” 
2:7 Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Should I go and call a nurse from the Hebrews to nurse the child for you?” 
2:8 Pharaoh’s daughter told her, “Go!” So the girl went and called the child’s mother. 
2:9 Then Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him. 
2:10 After the boy grew older she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son. So she named him Moses saying, “Because I drew him out of the water.” 
2:11 Now it happened in those days, after Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brothers and saw their burdens. He noticed an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people. 
2:12 So he looked around and when he saw that there was nobody, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. 
2:13 Then he went out the following day, and saw two Hebrew men fighting. So he said to the guilty one, “Why are you beating your companion?” 
2:14 But the man answered, “Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? Are you saying you’re going to kill me—just as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid, and thought, “For sure the deed had become known.” 
2:15 When Pharaoh heard about this, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, where he sat down by a well. 
2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters who came and drew water. They filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. 
2:17 But shepherds came and drove them away, so Moses stood up, helped them and watered their flock. 
2:18 When they came to Reuel their father, he said, “How come you’ve returned so soon today?” 
2:19 So they told him, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds. He also drew water for us and watered the flock.” 
2:20 “Where is he then?” he said to his daughters. “Why did you leave the man behind? Invite him to have some food to eat!” 
2:21 Moses was content to stay on with the man. Later he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah. 
2:22 She gave birth to a son and he named him Gershom, saying, “I have been an outsider in a foreign land.” 
2:23  groaned because of their slavery. They cried out and their cry from slavery went up to God. 
2:24 God heard their sobbing and remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
2:25 , and He was concerned about them.
3:1 Now Moses was tending the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. So he led the flock to the farthest end of the wilderness, coming to the mountain of God, Horeb. 
3:2  appeared to him in a flame of fire from within a bush. So he looked and saw the bush burning with fire, yet it was not consumed. 
3:3 Moses thought, “I will go now, and see this great sight. Why is the bush not burnt?” 
3:4 .” 
3:5 Then He said, “Come no closer. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.” 
3:6 Moreover He said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.” So Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God. 
3:7  said, “I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their slave masters, for I know their pains. 
3:8 So I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, to bring them up out of that land into a good and large land, a land flowing with milk and honey, into the place of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. 
3:9  has come to Me. Moreover I have seen the oppression that the Egyptians have inflicted on them. 
3:10  out from Egypt.” 
3:11  out of Egypt?” 
3:12 So He said, “I will surely be with you. So that will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you. When you have brought the people out of Egypt: you will worship God on this mountain.” 
3:13  and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is His Name?’ What should I say to them?” 
3:14 , ‘I AM’ has sent me to you.” 
3:15 , the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My Name forever, and the Name by which I should be remembered from generation to generation. 
3:16 , the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—has appeared to me, saying, I have been paying close attention to you and have seen what is done to you in Egypt. 
3:17 So I promise I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt, into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.’ 
3:18  our God.’ 
3:19 Nevertheless, I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, except by a mighty hand. 
3:20 So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders that I will do in the midst of it. After that, he will let you go. 
3:21 “Then I shall grant these people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. So it will happen that when you go, you will not leave empty-handed. 
3:22 Every woman is to ask her neighbor and the woman who lives in her house for silver and gold jewelry and clothing. You will put them on your sons and your daughters. So you will plunder the Egyptians.”
4:1  has not appeared to you.’” 
4:2  said to him, “What is that in your hand?” “A staff,” he said. 
4:3 Then He said, “Cast it on the ground.” When he cast it to the ground, it became a serpent, so Moses fled from before it. 
4:4  said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand, and take it by the tail.” So he put out his hand, laid hold of it, and it became a staff in his hand. 
4:5 , the God of their fathers—the God of Abra­ham, Isaac and Jacob—has appeared to you.” 
4:6 —white as snow. 
4:7 Then He said, “Put your hand back into your cloak.” So he put his hand back in, and when he took it out it was restored again as the rest of his skin. 
4:8 Then He said, “If they do not believe you, or listen to the voice of the first sign, they will believe the message of the latter sign. 
4:9 But if they do not believe even these two signs nor listen to your voice, you are to take the water of the river and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the ground.” 
4:10 , I am not a man of words—not yesterday, nor the day before, nor since You have spoken to Your servant—because I have a slow mouth and a heavy tongue.” 
4:11 ? 
4:12 Now go! I will be with your mouth and teach you what to say.” 
4:13 But he said, “Please, please, send it by another hand.” 
4:14  was kindled against Moses, so He said, “In fact, Aaron the Levite is your brother. I know that he can speak well. Moreover, he is on his way to meet you! When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. 
4:15 You are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth and with his, and teach you what to do. 
4:16 He will be your spokesman to the people, so that he may act as a mouthpiece for you, and it will be as if you were as God for him. 
4:17 Now then, you must take this staff in your hand to do the signs.”
4:18 So Moses went, returned to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him, “Please let me go, so I may return to my kinsmen who are in Egypt and see whether they are still alive.” Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” 
4:19  said to Moses in Midian, “Go, return to Egypt, for all the men that sought your life are dead.” 
4:20 So Moses took his wife and his sons, set them on a donkey and returned to the land of Egypt. Moses took the staff of God in his hand. 
4:21  said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you do all the wonders before Pharaoh that I have put in your hand. Still, I will harden his heart, and he will not let the people go. 
4:22  says: ‘Israel is My son, My firstborn. 
4:23 So I have said to you, Let My son go, that he may serve Me, but you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will slay your son, your firstborn.’” 
4:24  met him and sought to kill him! 
4:25 But Zipporah took a flint, cut off the foreskin of her son, and threw it at his feet, saying, “You are surely a bridegroom of blood to me.” 
4:26 She said, “A bridegroom of blood” because of the circumcision. Then He let him alone. 
4:27  said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he went and met him at the mountain of God, and kissed him. 
4:28  with which He had been sent, along with all the signs that He had commanded him to do. 
4:29 . 
4:30  had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people. 
4:31  and had seen their affliction, they bowed their heads and worshipped.
5:1 , God of Israel, says: Let My people go, so that they may hold a feast for Me in the wilderness.” 
5:2 , and besides, I will not let Israel go.” 
5:3  our God, or else He may strike us with pestilence or with the sword.” 
5:4 But the king of Egypt said to them, “Why do you, Moses and Aaron, make the people break loose from their work? Go to your labors!” 
5:5 Then Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now so numerous, yet you would have them rest from their labors?” 
5:6 Then on the same day Pharaoh commanded the slave masters of the people and their foremen saying, 
5:7 “You are not to give the people any more straw to make bricks, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
5:8 But impose on them the quota of bricks that they made previously; don’t reduce it. For they are lazy—that’s why they cry out saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ 
5:9 Let even heavier work be laid upon the men, so that they must labor, paying no attention to deceptive words.” 
5:10 Then the slave masters of the people went out, along with their officers, and they spoke to the people saying: “This is what Pharaoh says: I will not give you straw. 
5:11 Go and get straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, for there will be no reduction of your work.” 
5:12 So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 
5:13 But the slave masters pressured, saying, “Fulfill your work, your daily amount, just as when there was straw.” 
5:14 , whom Pharaoh’s slave masters had set over them, were beaten and asked, “Why haven’t you met your quota of bricks, both yesterday and today like before?” 
5:15  came and cried out to Pharaoh saying, “Why do you deal this way with your servants? 
5:16 No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’ and look, your servants are beaten. But it is your own people at fault.” 
5:17 .’ 
5:18 So go now and work! No straw will be given to you—but you must deliver the quota of bricks.” 
5:19  saw that they were in trouble when they were told, “You are not to reduce the number of bricks from day to day.” 
5:20 Then they met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them as they came from Pharaoh. 
5:21  look on you and judge, because you have made us a stench in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants—putting a sword in their hand to kill us!” 
5:22 , why have You brought evil on these people? Is this why You sent me? 
5:23 Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your Name, he has brought evil on these people. You have not delivered Your people at all.”
6:1  said to Moses, “Now you will see what I am going to do to Pharaoh. By way of a strong hand he will let them go, and drive them out of his land.”
6:2 . 
6:3 , I made Myself known to them. 
6:4 I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage where they journeyed. 
6:5 , whom the Egyptians are keeping in bondage. So I have remembered My covenant. 
6:6 , and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments. 
6:7  your God, who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 
6:8 .” 
6:9 , but they did not listen to him because of their broken spirit and cruel bondage. 
6:10  told Moses, 
6:11  go out of his land.” 
6:12  have not listened to me. So how would Pharaoh listen to me—I, who have uncircumcised lips?” 
6:13  out of the land of Egypt. 
6:14 These are the heads of their father’s houses. The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These are the families of Reuben. 
6:15 The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These are the families of Simeon. 
6:16 These are the names of the sons of Levi ­according to their generations: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years. 
6:17 The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimei, according to their families. 
6:18 The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years. 
6:19 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations. 
6:20 Amram married Jochebed, his father’s sister, and she bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years. 
6:21 The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg and Zichri. 
6:22 The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan and Sithri. 
6:23 Aaron married Elisheba daughter of Amminadav, sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
6:24 The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah and Abiasaph. These are the families of the Korahites. 
6:25 Eleazar, Aaron’s son, married one of the daughters of Putiel and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the ancestral houses of the Levites according to their families. 
6:26  out from the land of Egypt according to their divisions.” 
6:27  out from Egypt. These are that same Moses and Aaron. 
6:28  spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, 
6:29 . Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything that I tell to you.” 
6:30 , “I am of uncircumcised lips, so how would Pharaoh listen to me?”
7:1  said to Moses, “See, I have set you as God to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother will be your prophet. 
7:2  go out of his land. 
7:3 Yet I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply My signs and wonders in the land of Egypt. 
7:4 , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. 
7:5  from among them.” 
7:6  commanded them. 
7:7 Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh. 
7:8  told Moses and Aaron, 
7:9 “When Pharaoh speaks to you saying, ‘Prove yourselves with a miracle,’ then you are to say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and cast it down before Pharaoh, so that it may become a serpent.’” 
7:10  had commanded. Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 
7:11 Then Pharaoh called for the wise men and the sorcerers, and they too, the magicians of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts. 
7:12 For each man threw down his staff, and they became serpents. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs. 
7:13  had said.
7:14  said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is stubborn; he refuses to let the people go. 
7:15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he is coming out to the water, and stand ready to meet him by the bank of the Nile. Take the staff that was transformed into a serpent in your hand. 
7:16 , God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, ‘Let My people go, so they may serve Me in the wilderness,’ and behold, you have not listened. 
7:17 . Behold, I will strike the waters that are in the river with the staff that is in my hand, and they will be turned to blood. 
7:18 The fish that are in the river will die, the river will become foul, and the Egyptians will hate to drink water from the Nile.”’ 
7:19  said to Moses, “Say to Aaron: Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, over their pools and over all their ponds, so that they become blood. There will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, even in wooden and stone containers.” 
7:20  commanded. He lifted up the staff and struck the waters that were in the river in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and all the waters of the Nile turned to blood. 
7:21 When the fish that were in the river died, the river became so foul that the Egyptians could not drink water from the river. The blood was throughout all the land of Egypt. 
7:22  had said. 
7:23 Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and did not even take it to heart. 
7:24 So all the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink, because they could not drink of the water from the Nile. 
7:25  had struck the Nile. 
8:1  told Moses, “Say to Aaron: Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, canals and pools, and cause frogs to come up over the land of Egypt.” 
8:2 So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land. 
8:3 But the magicians did the same with their secret arts and brought up frogs over the land of Egypt. 
8:4 .” 
8:5 Moses answered Pharaoh, “Boast about me after I pray for you. When am I to pray for you, your servants and your people, that the frogs would be cut off from you and your houses, and remain only in the Nile?” 
8:6  our God. 
8:7 The frogs will depart from you, from your houses, from your servants and from your people. They will remain only in the Nile.” 
8:8  concerning the frogs, which He had brought upon Pharaoh. 
8:9  acted according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out in the houses, the courts and the fields. 
8:10 They piled them together in large heaps, and the land stank. 
8:11  had said. 
8:12  said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, and it will become gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.’” 
8:13 So they did. When Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, there were gnats on men and animals. All the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt. 
8:14 When the magicians attempted the same with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, they could not. There were gnats on men and animals. 
8:15  had said. 
8:16  says: Let My people go, that they may serve Me. 
8:17 Or else, if you do not let My people go, I will send the swarm of flies on you and on your servants, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of the swarm of flies including the ground that they stand on. 
8:18 , am in the midst of the earth. 
8:19 I will make a distinction between My people and your people. By tomorrow this sign will happen.” 
8:20  did just so. A massive swarm of flies went into the house of Pharaoh and into his servant’s houses. All the land of Egypt was ruined because of the swarm of flies. 
8:21 So Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron and said, “Go! Sacrifice to your God—in the land.” 
8:22  our God are an abomination to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice what is an abomination to the Egyptians, wouldn’t they stone us? 
8:23  our God—just as He tells us.” 
8:24  your God in the wilderness. Only you must not go very far away. Pray for me.” 
8:25 .” 
8:26 . 
8:27  acted according to the word of Moses, and removed the swarm of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants and from his people. Nothing remained. 
8:28 But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and did not let the people go.
8:29
8:30
8:31
8:32
9:1 , the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘Let My people go, so they may serve Me.’ 
9:2 For if you refuse to let them go, and hold them still, 
9:3  will fall upon your livestock that are in the field—on the horses, donkeys, camels, herds and flocks. There will be a crushing plague. 
9:4 .” 
9:5  will do this thing in the land.” 
9:6 , not one died. 
9:7  dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go. 
9:8  said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from the furnace, and have Moses throw it heavenward in the sight of Pharaoh. 
9:9 It will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and will become boils erupting with sores on both men and animals throughout all the land.” 
9:10 So they took soot from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh. When Moses threw it heavenward, it became boils erupting with sores on both men and animals. 
9:11 Moreover, the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, because they were on the magicians, as on all the Egyptians. 
9:12  had said to Moses. 
9:13  the God of the Hebrews says: ‘Let My people go, so they may serve Me. 
9:14 For this time I will send all My plagues to your heart, and on your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is none like Me in all the earth. 
9:15 Surely by now I could have stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth. 
9:16 However, I have let you stand for this reason: to show you My power, and that My Name might be proclaimed throughout all the earth. 
9:17 Yet still you exalt yourself over My people, by not letting them go. 
9:18 Behold, tomorrow at about this time, I will cause it to rain a very severe hailstorm, the likes of which has not occurred in Egypt since the day it was founded until now. 
9:19 Send word, shelter your cattle and all that you have in the field. For every person and animal found in the field and not brought home, when the hail comes down on them, they will die.’” 
9:20  among the servants of Pharaoh had his own servants and cattle flee into the houses, 
9:21  left his servants and cattle in the field. 
9:22  said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven and let there be hail in all the land of Egypt, on people, animals and every plant of the field, throughout all the land.” 
9:23  rained hail on the land of Egypt. 
9:24 The hail fell very severely, with fire flashing up amidst the hail, the likes of which had not occurred in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 
9:25 The hail struck down everything that was in the fields, both men and animals, all throughout the land of Egypt. It also struck every plant of the field and broke down every tree. 
9:26  were, was there no hail. 
9:27  is righteous, while I and my people are wicked. 
9:28 —there has been enough of God’s thunders and hail! I will let you go. You don’t have to stay any longer.” 
9:29 ’s. 
9:30 .” 
9:31 (The flax and the barley were destroyed, because the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom. 
9:32 But the wheat and the spelt were not destroyed, because they ripen later.) 
9:33 . Then the thunder and hail ceased, and rain no longer poured down on the earth. 
9:34 But when Pharaoh saw that the rain, the hail and the thunder had ceased, he increased his sin and hardened his heart, both he and his servants. 
9:35  had said by Moses’ hand.
10:1  said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, because I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, so that I might show these My signs in their midst, 
10:2 .” 
10:3 , the God of the Hebrews, says: How long would you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, so they may serve Me. 
10:4 Or else, if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your borders. 
10:5 Then they will cover the face of the earth, so that no one will be able to see the ground. They will eat the remainder of what escaped—whatever is left from the hail—and eat every tree that grows for you out in the field. 
10:6 Your houses will be filled, as will the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Egyptians, as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen since the day they were on the earth until today!” Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh. 
10:7  their God. Don’t you realize yet that Egypt is being destroyed?” 
10:8  your God,” he said. “But who will be going?” 
10:9 ’s feast for Him.” 
10:10  be with you, if I ever do let you go, with your little ones. See clearly now! Evil is in your face. 
10:11 ! For that’s what you were seeking.” Then they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence. 
10:12  said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, so they may come up onto Egypt and eat every plant in the land—everything the hail has left.” 
10:13  brought an east wind over the land all that day and all night. When it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. 
10:14 The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and rested on the entire territory of Egypt. So dense—there was nothing like it before them, nor will there ever be again. 
10:15 For they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened, and they ate every plant in the land and all the fruit from the trees that the hail had left. No green thing remained, not a tree or a plant of the field throughout all the land of Egypt. 
10:16  your God and against you. 
10:17  your God—just so He would take this death away from me!” 
10:18 . 
10:19  turned the wind from the west, very strong, and it carried off the locusts and drove them into the Sea of Reeds. Not one locust remained in all the territory of Egypt. 
10:20  go. 
10:21  said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, and there will be darkness over the land of Egypt—a darkness that may be felt.” 
10:22 So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days. 
10:23  had light within their dwellings. 
10:24 . Only let your flocks and your herds remain. Your little ones may also go with you.” 
10:25  our God. 
10:26  until we ­arrive there.” 
10:27  hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was unwilling to let them go. 
10:28 So Pharaoh said to him, “Go away from me! Take heed never to see my face again, because on the day you do, you will die!” 
10:29 “Right!” Moses said. “You said it! May I never see your face again!”
11:1  had said to Moses, “I will bring one more plague upon Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will surely thrust you out altogether from here. 
11:2 Speak now into the ears of the people, and let every man ask from his neighbor and every woman from her neighbor for articles of silver and gold.” 
11:3  gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. Indeed, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants and in the eyes of the people. 
11:4  says: At around midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt, 
11:5 and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt will die—from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the maidservant behind the mill, along with all the firstborn cattle. 
11:6 There will be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, the likes of which has never been before nor will ever be again. 
11:7  makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel. 
11:8 All these servants of yours will come down to me and bow down to me, saying, ‘Get out, you and all the people who follow you!’ After that, I will go.” Then he went out from Pharaoh hot with anger. 
11:9  had said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.” 
11:10  go out of his land.
12:1  spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying, 
12:2 “This month will mark the beginning of months for you; it is to be the first month of the year for you. 
12:3 Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month, each man is to take a lamb for his family one lamb for the household. 
12:4 But if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his nearest neighbor are to take one according to the number of the people. According to each person eating, you are to make your count for the lamb. 
12:5 Your lamb is to be without blemish, a year old male. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats. 
12:6 You must watch over it until the fourteenth day of the same month. Then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to slaughter it at twilight. 
12:7 They are to take the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the crossbeam of the houses where they will eat it. 
12:8  and bitter herbs they are to eat it. 
12:9 Do not eat any of it raw or boiled with water, but only roasted with fire—its head with its legs and its innards. 
12:10 So let nothing of it remain until the morning. Whatever remains until the morning you are to burn with fire. 
12:11 ’s Passover. 
12:12 . 
12:13 The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are. When I see the blood, I will pass over you. So there will be no plague among you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt. 
12:14 . Throughout your generations you are to keep it as an eternal ordinance. 
12:15  from the first day until the seventh day, that soul will be cut off from Israel. 
12:16 The first day is to be a holy assembly for you as well as the seventh day. No manner of work is to be done on those days, except what is to be eaten by every person—that alone may be prepared by you. 
12:17 So you are to observe the Feast of Matzot, for on this very same day have I brought your ranks out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you are to observe this day throughout your generations as an eternal ordinance. 
12:18  , until the evening of the twenty-first day of the month. 
12:19 , that soul will be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is an outsider or one who is born in the land. 
12:20  .” 
12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go, select lambs for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb. 
12:22 You are to take a bundle of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and apply it to the crossbeam and two doorposts with the blood from the basin. None of you may go out the door of his house until morning. 
12:23  will pass over that door, and will not allow the destroyer to come into your houses to strike you down. 
12:24 Also you are to observe this event as an eternal ordinance, for you and your children. 
12:25  will give you as He has promised, you are to keep this ceremony. 
12:26  Now when it happens that your children ask you, ‘What does this ceremony mean to you?’ 
12:27  in Egypt, when He struck down the Egyptians, but spared our households.’” So the people bowed their heads and worshipped. 
12:28  had commanded Moses and Aaron. 
12:29  struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn cattle. 
12:30 Then Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians, and there was loud wailing in Egypt. For there was not a house where someone was not dead. 
12:31  as you have said. 
12:32 Take your flocks and your herds, as you said, and be gone! But bless me, too.” 
12:33 Now the Egyptians urged the people, sending them out of the land quickly, for they thought, “We will all be dead!” 
12:34 So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls bound up in their clothes on their shoulders. 
12:35  acted ­according to the word of Moses. They asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold, and for clothing. 
12:36  gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians and let them have what they asked for. So they plundered the Egyptians. 
12:37  journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about 600,000 men on foot, as well as children. 
12:38 Also a mixed multitude went up with them, along with the flocks, herds and heavy livestock. 
12:39 , because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not delay, so they had not made provisions for themselves. 
12:40  lived in Egypt was 430 years. 
12:41  went out from the land of Egypt. 
12:42  throughout their generations. 
12:43  said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the ordinance of the Passover. No foreigner may eat it, 
12:44 but every man’s servant that is bought for money, after you have circumcised him, may eat it. 
12:45 Nor should a visitor or hired servant eat it. 
12:46 It is to be eaten inside a single house. You are not to carry the meat out of the house, nor are you to break any of its bones. 
12:47 All the congregation of Israel must keep it. 
12:48 , all his males must be circumcised. Then let him draw near and keep it. He will be like one who is native to the land. But no uncircumcised person may eat from it. 
12:49  applies to the native as well as the outsider who dwells among you.” 
12:50  commanded Moses and Aaron. 
12:51  out of the land of Egypt as armies.
13:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
13:2 , both men and animals—this is Mine.” 
13:3  may be eaten. 
13:4 This day, in the month of Aviv, you are going out. 
13:5  brings you into the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you are to observe this service during this month. 
13:6 . 
13:7  is to be seen among you, nor within any of your borders. 
13:8  did for me when I came out of Egypt. 
13:9  has brought you out of Egypt. 
13:10  from year to year. 
13:11  brings you into the land of the Canaanite, as He swore to you and your fathers and gives it you, 
13:12 ’s. 
13:13 Every firstborn donkey you are to redeem with a lamb, and if you do not redeem it, then you are to break its neck. But you are to redeem every firstborn male among your sons. 
13:14  brought us out from Egypt, the house of bondage, 
13:15  all firstborn males, but I redeem the firstborn of my sons.’ 
13:16  brought us out of Egypt.”
13:17 After Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not lead them along the road to the land of the Philistines, although that was nearby, for God said, “The people might change their minds if they see war and return to Egypt.” 
13:18  went up out of the land of Egypt armed. 
13:19  swear an oath saying, “God will surely remember you, and then you are to carry my bones away with you.” 
13:20 So they journeyed from Succoth and encamped in Etham, on the edge of the wilderness. 
13:21  went before them in a pillar of cloud by day to lead the way and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light. So they could travel both day and night. 
13:22 The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night never departed from the people.
14:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
14:2 , so that they turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. You are to camp by the sea, opposite Baal-zephon. 
14:3 , ‘They are wandering aimlessly in the land—the wilderness has shut them in!’ 
14:4 .” So they did so. 
14:5 When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart toward the people, and they said, “What is this we have done, that we let Israel go from serving us?” 
14:6 So he prepared his chariots and took his people with him. 
14:7 He took 600 of the finest chariots, along with all other chariots of Egypt, and captains over them. 
14:8  went out with a high hand. 
14:9 But the Egyptians pursued them with all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, as well as his charioteers and his army, and overtook them as they were encamped by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth opposite Baal-zephon. 
14:10 . 
14:11 They said to Moses, “Have you taken us away to die in the wilderness because there were no graves in Egypt? Why have you dealt this way with us, to bring us out of Egypt? 
14:12 Did we not say to you in Egypt, ‘Let us alone, so that we may serve the Egyptians?’ It was better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness!” 
14:13 , which He will perform for you today. You have seen the Egyptians today, but you will never see them again, ever! 
14:14  will fight for you, while you hold your peace.” 
14:15  to go forward. 
14:16  will go into the midst of the sea on dry ground. 
14:17 Then I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they will go in after them, so that I will be glorified over Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots and his horsemen. 
14:18 , when I have been glorified over Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen.” 
14:19 Then the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them. Also the pillar of cloud moved from in front and stood behind them, 
14:20 and so came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel—there was the cloud and the darkness over here, yet it gave light by night over there—neither one came near the other all night long. 
14:21  drove the sea back with a strong east wind throughout the night and turned the sea into dry land. So the waters were divided. 
14:22  went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, while the waters were like walls to them on their right and on their left. 
14:23 But the Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots and his horsemen. 
14:24  looked at the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud and caused the army of the Egyptians to panic. 
14:25  fights for them against the Egyptians!” 
14:26  said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, so that the waters come back upon the Egyptians, over their chariots and their horsemen.” 
14:27  overthrew them in the midst of the sea. 
14:28 The waters returned and covered the chariots, the horsemen and the entire army of Pharaoh that went after them into the sea. Not one of them remained. 
14:29  had walked on dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were like walls to them on their right hand and on their left. 
14:30  saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. 
14:31  and in His servant Moses.
15:1 , for He is highly exalted! The horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea. 
15:2  is my strength and song, and He has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will glorify Him, my father’s God, and I will exalt Him. 
15:3  is His Name! 
15:4 Pharaoh’s chariots and his army He has hurled into the sea, and his chosen captains have sunk into the Sea of Reeds. 
15:5 The deeps cover them. They sank to the depths like a stone. 
15:6 , dashes the enemy to pieces. 
15:7 In the greatness of Your excellency You overthrow those who resist You. You send forth Your wrath— it consumes them as stubble. 
15:8 With the blast of Your nostrils the waters piled up. The floods stood upright as a heap. The deeps became firm ground in the heart of the sea. 
15:9 The enemy said, “I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil. My lust shall gorge on them! I will draw my sword— my hand will destroy them.” 
15:10 You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters. 
15:11 , among the gods? Who is like You, glorious in holiness, awesome in praises, doing wonders? 
15:12 You stretched out Your right hand, the earth swallowed them. 
15:13 You in Your lovingkindness led the people You have redeemed. You guided them in Your strength to Your holy habitation. 
15:14 When the peoples hear, they will tremble—anguish will seize the inhabitants of Philistia. 
15:15 Then the chiefs of Edom are terrified. Trembling grips Moab’s mighty men. All of Canaan’s inhabitants will melt away. 
15:16 , till the people whom You purchased cross over. 
15:17 , which Your hands have prepared. 
15:18  will reign forever and ever! 
15:19  walked in the midst of the sea on dry ground. 
15:20 Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dancing, 
15:21 , for He is highly exalted! The horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea!
15:22 Then Moses led Israel onward from the Sea of Reeds. They went out into the wilderness of Shur. But they travelled three days in the wilderness and found no water. 
15:23 When they came to Marah, they could not drink from the waters because they were bitter. On account of this it was called Marah. 
15:24 So the people complained to Moses saying, “What are we going to drink?” 
15:25  showed him a tree. When he threw it into the waters, they were made sweet. There He made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there He tested them. 
15:26  who heals you.” 
15:27 Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees. So they camped there by the waters.
16:1  came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after leaving the land of Egypt. 
16:2  murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. 
16:3  in the land of Egypt, when we sat by pots of meat, when we ate bread until we were full. But you have brought us into the wilderness, to kill this entire congregation with hunger.” 
16:4  or not. 
16:5 So on the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather day by day.” 
16:6  has brought you out from the land of Egypt, 
16:7 . For He heard your complaining against Him. What are we? You complain against us?” 
16:8 !” 
16:9 , because He has heard your complaining.’” 
16:10  appeared in the cloud. 
16:11  spoke to Moses saying, 
16:12  your God.’” 
16:13 So when evening fell, quails came up and covered the camp. Moreover, in the morning there was a layer of dew all around the camp. 
16:14 When the layer of dew was gone, on the surface of the desert was a thin, flake-like frost, as fine as the frost on the ground. 
16:15  has given you to eat. 
16:16  has commanded. Every man is to gather according to his needs, an omer per person, according to the number of people per household. Each man is to take it for those who are in his tent.” 
16:17  did so, and some gathered more, some less. 
16:18 When they measured it with an omer, those who gathered more had nothing left over, and those that gathered less did not lack at all. Every man gathered according to his appetite. 
16:19 Also Moses said to them, “Let no one save any of it until the morning.” 
16:20 However, they did not listen to Moses. Some of them preserved it until the morning—but it bred worms and rotted. So Moses was angry with them. 
16:21 So they gathered it morning by morning, each man according to his needs, and as the sun became hot it melted. 
16:22 On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each individual. So all the leaders of the community came and informed Moses. 
16:23 . Bake whatever you would bake, and boil what you would boil. Store up for yourselves everything that remains, to be kept until the morning.” 
16:24 So they set it aside until the morning, just as Moses instructed, and it did not rot nor were there any worms. 
16:25 . Today you will not find it in the field. 
16:26 You are to gather it for six days, but the seventh day is the Shabbat, and there will be none.” 
16:27 Yet on the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather and they found none. 
16:28 ? 
16:29  has given you the Shabbat, so on the sixth day He gives you the bread of two days. Let every man stay in his place, and let no man go out on the seventh day.” 
16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day. 
16:31  . It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey. 
16:32  has commanded. Let a full omer of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out from the land of Egypt.” 
16:33 , to be kept throughout your generations.” 
16:34  commanded Moses, Aaron stored it up in front of the Testimony, to be preserved. 
16:35  until they came to an inhabited land, when they came to the borders of the land of Canaan. 
16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
17:1 , and camped in Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. 
17:2 ?” 
17:3 But the people thirsted for water there, and they complained against Moses and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt? To kill us with thirst, along with our children and cattle?” 
17:4  saying, “What am I to do for these people? They are about ready to stone me.” 
17:5  said to Moses, “Walk before the people, and take of the elders of Israel with you, along with your staff with which you struck the river. Take it in your hand and go. 
17:6 Behold, I will stand before you, there upon the rock in Horeb. You are to strike the rock, and water will come out of it so that the people can drink.” Then Moses did just so in the eyes of the elders of Israel. 
17:7  among us, or not?”
17:8 Then the Amalekites came and fought with Israel at Rephidim. 
17:9 Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men, go out, and fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.” 
17:10 So Joshua did as Moses said, and fought the Amalekites, while Moses, Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
17:11 When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed. But when he let down his hand, the Amalekites prevailed. 
17:12 Moses’ hands grew heavy, so they took a stone, put it under him, and he sat down. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on each side. So his hands were steady until the sun went down. 
17:13 So Joshua overpowered the Amalekites and his army with the edge of the sword. 
17:14  said to Moses, “Write this for a memorial in the book, and rehearse it in the hearing of Joshua, for I will utterly blot out the memory of the Amalekites from under heaven.” 
17:15 -Nissi. 
17:16  will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.”
18:1  had brought Israel out of Egypt. (
18:2 Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, had taken in Moses’ wife Zipporah, after he had sent her away 
18:3 with her two sons. One was named Gershom because he said, “I have been an outsider in a foreign land,” 
18:4 and the name of the other was Eliezer because he said, “For my father’s God is my help , and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.”) 
18:5 So Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped at the mountain of God. 
18:6 He had told Moses, “I, Jethro your father-in-law, am coming to you, along with your wife and her two sons.” 
18:7 So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, then bowed down and kissed him. They asked each other about their welfare, and went into the tent. 
18:8  delivered them. 
18:9  had shown to Israel, since He had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians. 
18:10 , who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh, and has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. 
18:11  is greater than all gods, since they had acted arrogantly against them.” 
18:12 Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, presented a burnt offering and sacrifices to God. Aaron also came along with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God. 
18:13 The next day, Moses sat to judge the people, and they stood around Moses from morning till evening. 
18:14 When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did for the people, he said, “What’s this you’re doing to the people? Why sit by yourself, alone, with all the people standing around from morning until evening?” 
18:15 Moses answered his father-in-law, “It’s because the people come to me to inquire of God. 
18:16 When they have an issue, it comes to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, so I make them understand God’s statutes and His laws.” 
18:17 But Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “What you’re doing is no good. 
18:18 You will surely wear yourself out, as well as these people who are with you, because the task is too heavy for you. You cannot do it alone, by yourself. 
18:19 Now listen to my voice—I will give you advice, and may God be with you! You, represent the people before God, and bring their cases to God. 
18:20 Enlighten them as to the statutes and the laws, and show them the way by which they must walk and the work they must do. 
18:21 But you should seek out capable men out of all the people—men who fear God, men of truth, who hate bribery. Appoint them to be rulers over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. 
18:22 Let them judge the people all the time. Then let every major case be brought to you, but every minor case they can judge for themselves. Make it easier for yourself, as they bear the burden with you. 
18:23 .” 
18:24 So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said. 
18:25 Moses chose capable men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. 
18:26 They judged the people all the time. The hard cases they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. 
18:27 Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went on his way to his own land.
19:1  had gone out of the land of Egypt, that same day they arrived at the wilderness of Sinai. 
19:2 They travelled from Rephidim, came into to the wilderness of Sinai, and set up camp in the wilderness. Israel camped there, right in front of the mountain. 
19:3 , 
19:4 ‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I carried you on eagle’s wings and brought you to Myself. 
19:5 Now then, if you listen closely to My voice, and keep My covenant, then you will be My own treasure from among all people, for all the earth is Mine. 
19:6 .” 
19:7  had commanded him. 
19:8 . 
19:9 . 
19:10  said to Moses, “Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow. Let them wash their clothing. 
19:11  will come down upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. 
19:12 You are to set boundaries for the people all around, saying, ‘Be very careful not to go up onto the mountain, or touch the border of it. Whoever touches the mountain will surely be put to death. 
19:13  sounds, they may come up to the mountain.” 
19:14 Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people, consecrated them, and then, they washed their clothing. 
19:15 He said to the people, “Be ready for the third day. Do not draw near your wives.” 
19:16 . All the people in the camp trembled. 
19:17 Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the lowest part of the mountain. 
19:18  had descended upon it in fire. The smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace. The whole mountain quaked greatly. 
19:19  grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him with a thunderous sound. 
19:20  called Moses to the top of the mountain, so Moses went up. 
19:21 , and many of them die. 
19:22  does not break out against them.” 
19:23 , “The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for You are the One who warned us, saying, ‘Set boundaries around the mountain, and consecrate it.’” 
19:24 , or He will break out against them.” 
19:25 So Moses went down to the people and told them.
20:1 Then God spoke all these words saying, 
20:2  your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 
20:3 “You shall have no other gods before Me. 
20:4 Do not make for yourself a graven image , or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or on the earth below or in the water under the earth. 
20:5  your God, am a jealous God, bringing the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, 
20:6 . 
20:7  will not hold him guiltless that takes His Name in vain. 
20:8 “Remember Yom Shabbat, to keep it holy. 
20:9 You are to work six days, and do all your work, 
20:10  your God. In it you shall not do any work—not you, nor your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, your cattle, nor the outsider that is within your gates. 
20:11  blessed Yom Shabbat, and made it holy. 
20:12  your God is giving you. 
20:13 “Do not murder. 
20:14 “Do not commit adultery. 
20:15 “Do not steal. 
20:16 “Do not bear false witness against your neighbor. 
20:17 “Do not covet your neighbor’s house, your neighbor’s wife, his manservant, his maidservant, his ox, his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor’s.” 
20:18 , and the mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they trembled and stood far off. 
20:19 So they said to Moses, “You, speak to us, and we will listen, but do not let God speak to us, or we will die.” 
20:20 So Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid, for God has come to test you, so that His fear may be in you, so that you do not sin.” 
20:21 The people stood far off, while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was. 
20:22 : You yourselves have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven. 
20:23 Do not make gods of silver alongside Me, and do not make gods of gold for yourselves. 
20:24 You are to make an altar of earth for Me, and there you will sacrifice your burnt offerings, your fellowship offerings—your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I cause My name to be mentioned I will come to you and bless you. 
20:25 When you make for Me an altar of stones, do not build it from cut stone, for if you use a tool on it, you will have profaned it. 
20:26 Nor are you to go up to My altar on steps, so that your nakedness would not be uncovered while on it.”
21:1 “Now these are the ordinances which you will set before them. 
21:2 “If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve for six years, and in the seventh he is to go free, without payment. 
21:3 If he comes in by himself, he is to go out by himself. If he was married, then his wife will go out with him. 
21:4 If his master gave him a wife, and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children will be her master’s, and he will go free by himself. 
21:5 “But if the servant plainly states, ‘I love my master, my wife and my children, and I will not go out free,’ 
21:6 then his master is to bring him to God, then take him to a door or to a doorpost. His master is to pierce his ear through with an awl, and he will serve him forever. 
21:7 “If a man sells his daughter to be a maidservant, she is not to go free as the male servants do. 
21:8 If she does not please her master who has selected her for himself, then he is to allow her to be redeemed. He will have no power to sell her to a foreign people, seeing as he has dealt deceitfully toward her. 
21:9 If he betroths her to his son, he must give her the rights of a daughter. 
21:10 If he takes another wife, he is not to diminish her food, her clothing, or her marriage rights. 
21:11 If he does not provide these three to her, then she is to go free without payment. 
21:12 “Whoever strikes a man so that he dies must surely be put to death. 
21:13 But if he did not hunt him down, yet God caused it to happen, then I will appoint for you a place where he may run. 
21:14 If a man presumes to kill his neighbor with craftiness, you are to take him from My altar and put him to death. 
21:15 “Anyone who strikes his father or his mother must surely be put to death. 
21:16 “Anyone who steals a person and sells him, or is found with him under his hand, must surely be put to death. 
21:17 “Whoever curses his father or his mother must surely be put to death. 
21:18 “If people quarrel, and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist, and the other does not die but lies in bed, 
21:19 if he rises again and walks around on his staff, then the one that struck him he will be cleared. But he must pay for the loss of his time and help him to be thoroughly healed. 
21:20 “If a man strikes his male or female servant with a staff, who dies by his hand, he must surely be punished. 
21:21 Notwithstanding, if the servant gets up in a day or two he will not be punished, for he is his property. 
21:22 “If men fight, and hit a pregnant woman so that her child is born early, yet no harm follows, the one who hit her is to be strictly fined, according to what the woman’s husband demands of him. He must pay as the judges determine. 
21:23 But if any harm follows, then you are to penalize life for life, 
21:24 eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 
21:25 burn for burn, wound for wound, blow for blow. 
21:26 “If a man strikes the eye of his male or female slave and destroys it, he must let him go free for the sake of his eyesight. 
21:27 If he strikes out his slave’s tooth, he must let him go free for the sake of his tooth. 
21:28 “If an ox gores a man or a woman so that they die, the ox must surely be stoned, and its meat is not to be eaten, but the owner of the ox will be cleared. 
21:29 If the ox was given to goring in times past, and a warning has been given to its owner, yet he has not kept it pent up, and it has killed a man or a woman, then the ox must be stoned and its owner must also be put to death. 
21:30 If instead a ransom is placed on him, then he is to pay for the redemption of his life whatever is demanded. 
21:31 Whether it has gored a son or daughter, this rule is to be applied to him. 
21:32 If the ox gores a male or female slave, he is to pay 30 shekels of silver to their master, and the ox is to be stoned. 
21:33 “If one uncovers a pit or digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls in, 
21:34 the owner of the pit must pay compensation. He is to give money to the owner, and the dead animal will be his. 
21:35 “If one man’s ox hurts another’s ox so that it dies, they are to sell the live ox and divide the price. They are also to divide the dead one. 
21:36 Or if it becomes known that the ox was given to violence in times past, and its owner has not kept it pent up, he must surely pay ox for ox, and the dead animal will be his own. 
22:1 “If a thief found breaking in is struck so that he dies, there is no bloodguilt for him. 
22:2 But if the sun has risen, there is bloodguilt, and he is to make full restitution. If he has nothing, then he must be sold for his theft. 
22:3 If the item is found in his hand alive—whether ox, donkey or sheep—he is to pay double. 
22:4 “If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten by letting his animal loose, and it feeds in another man’s field, then he is to make restitution from the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard. 
22:5 “If fire breaks out and spreads among thorns, so that stalks of grain, standing grain or the fields themselves are consumed, then the one who lit the fire must make full restitution. 
22:6 “If a man entrusts his neighbor with money or items for safekeeping, and it is stolen out of the man’s house, when the thief is found, he must pay double. 
22:7 If the thief is not found, then the master of the house is to present himself to God, to see whether he has laid his hand on his neighbor’s goods. 
22:8 For any transgression—whether ox, donkey, sheep, clothing, or anything else lost—when someone says, ‘This is mine!’ the case of both parties is to be brought before God. The one whom God convicts is to pay double to his neighbor. 
22:9 “If a man entrusts his neighbor with a donkey, ox, sheep or any animal to care for, and it dies, is hurt or taken away with no one seeing, 
22:10  between the two of them, to determine whether or not he has laid his hand on his neighbor’s goods. The owner is to accept it with no restitution. 
22:11 But if indeed it was stolen from him, he is to make restitution to the owner. 
22:12 If it is torn in pieces, let him bring it as evidence. He is not required to pay for what has been torn to pieces. 
22:13 “If a man borrows anything belonging to his neighbor, and it is harmed or dies in the absence of the owner, he must make full restitution. 
22:14 But if the owner is present, he is not required to pay restitution. If it was rented, it is covered by the rental fee. 
22:15 “If a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged, and lies with her, he must pay a dowry for her to be his wife. 
22:16 But if her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he must weigh out silver equal to the dowry for virgins. 
22:17 “You must not permit a sorceress to live. 
22:18 “Anyone who lies with an animal must surely be put to death. 
22:19  alone, is to be put under a ban of destruction. 
22:20 “You must not exploit or oppress an outsider, for you were outsiders in the land of Egypt. 
22:21 “You must not mistreat any widow or orphan. 
22:22 If you mistreat them in any way, and they cry out to Me, I will surely hear their cry. 
22:23 My wrath will burn hot, and I will kill you with the sword. So your wives will become widows and your children will become orphans. 
22:24 “If you lend money to any of My people, to the poor among you, you are not to act like a debt collector with him, and you are not to charge him interest. 
22:25 If you ever take your neighbor’s cloak as a pledge, you are to return it to him before the sun goes down, 
22:26 for that is his only covering, his cloak for his skin. What will he sleep in? When he cries out to Me I will hear, because I am gracious. 
22:27 “Do not despise God, or curse a ruler of your people. 
22:28 “Do not hold back the fullness of your crops or your vintage. You are to present the firstborn of your sons to Me. 
22:29 “Do the same with your cattle and with your sheep. For seven days it is to be with its mother, and on the eighth day you are to give it to Me. 
22:30 “You are to be a holy people for Me. You must not eat any flesh torn by beasts in the field. You may throw it out to the dogs.
22:31
23:1 “Do not to spread a false report. Do not join hands with the wicked by becoming a malicious witness. 
23:2 “Do not follow a crowd to do evil. Nor are you to testify in a case, to follow a crowd and pervert justice. 
23:3 On the other hand, nor should you takes sides with a poor man in his case. 
23:4 “If you find your enemy’s ox or his donkey going astray, you must surely bring it back to him again. 
23:5 If you see the donkey of the one that hates you lying down under its burden, do not leave it. Rather, you are to release it with him. 
23:6 “You are not to pervert justice to your poor in his dispute. 
23:7 Stay far away from a false charge. Do not kill the innocent and the righteous, for I will not justify the guilty. 
23:8 Take no bribe, for a bribe blinds those who have sight, and perverts the words of the righteous. 
23:9 “Do not oppress an outsider, for you know the heart of an outsider, since you were outsiders in the land of Egypt. 
23:10 “For six years you are to sow your land and gather the increase. 
23:11 But during the seventh year you are to let it rest and lie fallow, so that the poor among your people may eat. Whatever they leave behind, the animals of the field may eat. You are to deal with your vineyard and your olive grove in the same way. 
23:12 “You are to do your work for six days, but on the seventh day you will rest, so that your ox and your donkey may have rest, and also the son of your handmaid and the outsider may be refreshed. 
23:13 “With all the things that I have said to you, take heed. Make no mention of the names of other gods, and do not let them be heard in your mouth.
23:14 “Three times in the year you are to ce­lebrate a festival for Me. 
23:15  as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Aviv, for that is when you came out from Egypt. No one is to appear before Me empty-handed. 
23:16 Also you are to observe the Feast of Harvest, the firstfruits of your labors that you sow in the field, as well as the Feast of the Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather your crops from the field. 
23:17 . 
23:18 . Nor is the fat of My feast to remain out all night until the morning. 
23:19  your God. “Do not boil a kid in its mother’s milk. 
23:20 “Behold, I am sending an angel before you, to guard you on the way and to bring you into the place that I have prepared. 
23:21 Watch for Him and listen to His voice. Do not rebel against Him because He will not pardon your transgression, for My Name is in Him. 
23:22 But if you listen closely to His voice, and do everything I say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries. 
23:23 For My angel will go before you, and bring you to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites and the Jebusites, and I will cut them off. 
23:24 You are not to bow down to their gods or serve them, or do what they do. Rather, you are to utterly overthrow them, and break their pillars in pieces. 
23:25  your God, and He will bless your food and your water. Moreover I will take sickness away from your midst. 
23:26 None will miscarry nor be barren in your land, and I will fill up the number of your days. 
23:27 “I will send My terror before you and throw all the people to whom you will come into panic, and make all your enemies turn their backs to you. 
23:28 I will send the hornet before you, which will drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites and the Hittites, from before you. 
23:29 I will not drive them out from before you in a single year. Otherwise the land would become desolate, and the animals of the field will multiply against you. 
23:30 But little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you are fruitful. Then you will possess the land. 
23:31 “I will set your border from the Sea of Reeds to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the Euphrates River. For I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you are to drive them out before you. 
23:32 Make no covenant with them or with their gods. 
23:33 They must not dwell in your land and cause you to sin against Me, for if you worship their gods, they will be a snare to you.”
24:1 , you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel, and worship from afar. 
24:2 , but the others may not draw near, nor are the people to go up with him.” 
24:3  has spoken, we will do.” 
24:4 , then rose up early in the morning, and built an altar below the mountain, along with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel. 
24:5 . 
24:6 Then Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins and the other half he poured out against the altar. 
24:7  has spoken, we will do and obey.” 
24:8  has cut with you, in agreement with all these words.” 
24:9 Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up. 
24:10 They saw the God of Israel, and under His feet was something like a pavement of sapphire, as clear as the very heavens. 
24:11 . So they beheld God, and ate and drank. 
24:12 , which I have written so that you may instruct them.” 
24:13 So Moses rose up along with his attendant Joshua, and Moses went up onto the mountain of God. 
24:14 To the elders he said, “Wait for us here until we come back to you. See, Aaron and Hur are with you—whoever has a dispute should go to them.” 
24:15 When Moses went up on the mountain, the cloud covered it. 
24:16  settled upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days. Then on the seventh day He called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud. 
24:17 . 
24:18 So Moses entered into the midst of the cloud and went up onto the mountain. Moses was on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights.
25:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
25:2  to take up an offering for Me. From anyone whose heart compels him you are to take My offering.

28:18 a turquoise, a sapphire and a diamond for the second row; 
28:19 a jacinth, an agate and an amethyst for the third; 
28:20 and a beryl, an onyx and a jasper for the fourth row. They are to be enclosed in gold filigree settings. 
28:21 , twelve according to their names, like the etchings of a signet seal, one corresponding to each name of the twelve tribes. 
28:22 “Also you are to make, upon the breastplate, braided chains of wreathed work from pure gold. 
28:23 Forge on the breastplate two rings of gold and fasten the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. 
28:24 Then attach the two wreathed chains of gold on the two rings at the ends of the breastplate. 
28:25 The other two ends of the chains you are to place on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod in front. 
28:26 So you are to make two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, on the edge of it that is toward the inner side of the ephod. 
28:27 Also make two gold rings and place them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod underneath, in the front, close to where it is joined, above the artfully woven band of the ephod. 
28:28 Then they will bind the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue thread, so that it may be on the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and so that the breastplate will not come loose from it. 
28:29 . 
28:30  continually. 
28:31 “You are to make the robe of the ephod entirely of blue. 
28:32 It is to have a hole for the head in the center, and a binding of woven work around the hole, as a collar, so that it may not be torn. 
28:33 On the hem of it you are to make pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet, all around the hem, with golden bells between them: 
28:34 one golden bell and a pomegranate, then another golden bell and a pomegranate, on the hem of the robe all around. 
28:35  and when he comes out, so that he does not die. 
28:36 .’ 
28:37 Attach it with a violet cord onto the turban, on the front of the turban. 
28:38 . 
28:39 “You are to weave the tunic in checkered work of fine linen, make a turban of fine linen, and make a sash, the work of a color weaver. 
28:40 For Aaron’s sons you are to make tunics, sashes and headwear for them—for splendor and for beauty. 
28:41 . 
28:42 “You are to make linen undergarments for them, to cover the skin of their nakedness, from the hips to the thighs. 
28:43 They are to be worn by Aaron and his sons when they go into the Tent of Meeting or when they approach the altar to minister in the holy place, so that they do not become subject to guilt and die. It is to be a statute forever, to him and to his offspring after him.
29:1 . Take one young bull and two rams without blemish, 
29:2  wafers spread with oil. Make them from fine wheat flour. 
29:3 You are to put them into one basket and present them, along with the bull and the two rams. 
29:4 You are to bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and wash them with water. 
29:5 Then take the garments, and put the tunic on Aaron, along with the robe, the ephod and the breastplate. Gird him with the artfully woven band of the ephod, 
29:6 set the turban on his head, and put the holy coronet on the turban. 
29:7 Then you are to take the anointing oil, pour it upon his head and anoint him. 
29:8 Also you are to bring his sons and put tunics on them. 
29:9 You are to gird Aaron and his sons with sashes, tie headwear on them, and they shall hold the priesthood by a perpetual statute. In this way you are to consecrate Aaron and his sons. 
29:10 “You are to bring the bull before the Tent of Meeting, and Aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on its head. 
29:11  at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. 
29:12 Then take the blood of the bull, put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour out all the remaining blood at the base of the altar. 
29:13 Also take all the fat that covers the innards, the lobe above the liver, the two kidneys, along with the fat that is on them, and burn them on the altar. 
29:14 But the meat of the bull, along with its skin and its dung, you are to burn with fire outside the camp. It is a sin offering. 
29:15 “Then take one ram, have Aaron and his sons lay their hands upon the head of the ram, 
29:16 then slaughter the ram, take its blood, and sprinkle it around the altar. 
29:17 You are to cut the ram into pieces, wash its innards and its legs, and place them with its head and other pieces. 
29:18 . 
29:19 “Then take the other ram, and have Aaron and his sons lay their hands upon the head of that ram. 
29:20 Slaughter the ram, take its blood, and dab it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron, on the tip of the right ears of his sons, on the thumb of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet, then pour the blood on the altar all around. 
29:21 Also you are to take some of the blood that is on the altar, along with the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron and his garments, and on his sons and their garments. In this way he and his garments are to be consecrated, along with his sons and their garments. 
29:22 “Moreover, take some of the fat from the ram, along with the fat tail, the fat that covers the innards, the covering over the liver, the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, along with the right thigh, because it is a ram of consecration. 
29:23 . 
29:24 . 
29:25 . 
29:26 —so it will be your portion. 
29:27 “Set apart the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution, which is waved and offered up, from the ram of consecration, including what belongs to Aaron and his sons. 
29:28 . 
29:29 “The holy garments of Aaron are to pass to his sons after him, to be anointed in them and to be consecrated in them. 
29:30 , who comes into the Tent of Meeting to minister in the holy place, is to put them on for seven days. 
29:31 “You are to take the ram of consecration and boil its meat in a holy place. 
29:32 Aaron and his sons are to eat the meat of the ram and the bread that is in the basket at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. 
29:33 They are to eat those things with which atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them, but a layman is not to eat them, because they are holy. 
29:34 If some of the meat of the consecration or the bread remains until the morning, you are to burn the remainder with fire. It shall not be eaten, because it is holy. 
29:35 “Do for Aaron and his sons everything according to what I have commanded you. Consecrate them for seven days. 
29:36 Each day you are to offer a bull as a sin offering, apart from the other offerings of atonement. Also purify the altar when you make atonement for it, and anoint it in order to sanctify it. 
29:37 You are to make atonement for the altar for seven days, and so sanctify it. The altar will be most holy, and whatever touches it will become holy. 
29:38 “Now this is what you are to offer upon the altar: two one-year-old lambs, each day, continually. 
29:39 You are to offer one lamb in the morning and the other lamb at dusk. 
29:40 Offer along with the first lamb a tenth of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering. 
29:41 . 
29:42 . There I will meet with you, to speak with you there. 
29:43  there. So it will be sanctified by My glory. 
29:44 . 
29:45  and be their God. 
29:46  their God.
30:1 “You are to make an altar of acacia wood for burning incense. 
30:2 It is to be square—one cubit in length, one cubit wide, and two cubits high. The horns must be of one piece with it. 
30:3 You are to overlay it with pure gold on top, all around the sides and over the horns. Also you are to make a crown of gold for it all around. 
30:4 Make two golden rings for it under the crown on the two sides, and they will be holders for poles to carry it. 
30:5 Make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold. 
30:6 You are to set it in front of the curtain that is in front of the Ark of the Testimony, in front of the atonement cover that is over the Testimony, where I will meet with you. 
30:7 “Aaron must burn sweet spices of incense there every morning. When he attends to the lamps, he is to burn it. 
30:8 , throughout your generations. 
30:9 You must not offer up unauthorized incense on it. Nor should any burnt offering or grain offering be there, nor should you pour any drink offering there. 
30:10 .”
30:11  spoke to Moses saying, 
30:12  when you count them, so that no plague will fall on them. 
30:13 . 
30:14 . 
30:15  to make atonement for your souls. 
30:16 , to make atonement for your souls.”
30:17  spoke to Moses saying, 
30:18 “You will also make a basin of bronze with a bronze stand for washing. You are to place it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it. 
30:19 Aaron and his sons are to wash their hands and their feet there. 
30:20 , they are to wash with water so that they do not die. 
30:21 They are to wash their hands and their feet, so that they do not die. It is to be an eternal statute for them, to him and to his offspring throughout their generations.”
30:22  spoke to Moses saying, 
30:23 “Now take for yourself the best spices: 500 shekels of flowing myrrh, half as much sweet cinnamon (250), also 250 shekels of sweet calamus, 
30:24 500 of cassia, after the Sanctuary shekel, plus a hin of olive oil. 
30:25 You are to make holy anointing oil from it, a fragrant mixture, blended as the work of a perfumer. It will be holy anointing oil. 
30:26 You are to anoint the Tent of Meeting with it, the Ark of the Testimony, 
30:27  and its articles, the altar of incense, 
30:28 the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin along with its stand. 
30:29 You are to consecrate them so that they will be most holy. Whatever touches them will become holy. 
30:30 . 
30:31  saying, ‘This is to be a holy anointing oil to Me throughout your generations. 
30:32 It must not be poured on human flesh, nor are you to make any like it, with its formula. It is holy and it must be holy to you. 
30:33 Whoever mixes any like it, or whoever puts any of it on anyone unauthorized, will be cut off from his people.’” 
30:34  said to Moses, “Take the sweet spices—stacte, onycha and galbanum. The spices and pure frankincense are to be in equal measures. 
30:35 Make a fragrant mixture from them, a blend like the work of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy. 
30:36 You are to beat some of it into powder, and set it before the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It is to be most holy to you. 
30:37 . 
30:38 Whoever makes any like it, to breathe in its smell, will be cut off from his people.”
31:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
31:2 “See, I have called by name Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, 
31:3 and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, understanding and knowledge in all kinds of craftsmanship, 
31:4 to make ingenious designs, to forge with gold, silver and bronze, 
31:5 as well as cutting stones for setting and carving wood, to work in all manner of craftsmanship. 
31:6 Also look, I Myself have appointed with him Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. Within the hearts of all who are wise-hearted I have placed skill, so that they may make everything that I have commanded you: 
31:7 the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of the Testimony, the atonement cover that is to be on it, all the furnishings of the Tabernacle, 
31:8  of pure gold with all of its utensils, the altar of incense, 
31:9 the altar of burnt offering with all of its utensils, the basin and its stand, 
31:10 , 
31:11 the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place. They are to make them just as how I commanded you.”
31:12  spoke to Moses saying, 
31:13  who sanctifies you. 
31:14 Therefore you are to keep the Shabbat, because it is holy for you. Everyone who profanes it will die, for whoever does any work during Shabbat, that soul will be cut off from the midst of his people. 
31:15  will surely be put to death. 
31:16  throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant. 
31:17  made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He ceased from work and rested.’” 
31:18 When He had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, He gave the two tablets of the Testimony to Moses—tablets of stone, written by the finger of God.
32:1 Now when the people saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said to him, “Get up, make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what’s become of him!” 
32:2 So Aaron said to them, “Break off the golden rings that are in the ears of your wives, your sons and your daughters, and bring them to me.” 
32:3 So all the people broke off the golden rings that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron. 
32:4 He received them from their hand, and made a molten calf, fashioned with a chiseling tool. Then they said, “This is your god, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt!” 
32:5 .” 
32:6 They rose up early the next morning, sacrificed burnt offerings and brought fellowship offerings. The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to make merry. 
32:7  said to Moses, “Go down! For your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have become debased. 
32:8 They quickly turned aside from the path that I commanded for them. They have made a molten calf, worshipped it, and sacrificed to it, and said, ‘This is your god, O Israel, that brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’” 
32:9  said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people. 
32:10 Now therefore, leave Me alone, so My wrath may burn hot against them, and so I may consume them—and make from you a great nation!” 
32:11 , why should Your wrath burn hot against Your people, whom You have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? 
32:12 Why should the Egyptians say, ‘He brought them out to do evil, to slay them in the mountains, and to annihilate them from the face of the earth?’ Turn from Your fierce wrath, and relent from this destruction against Your people. 
32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your own self, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your offspring, and they will inherit it forever.’” 
32:14  relented from the destruction that He said He would do to His people. 
32:15 Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand, tablets that were written on both sides, on one and on the other. 
32:16 The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets. 
32:17 When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is the sound of war within the camp.” 
32:18 But Moses said: “It is not the voice of a shout of victory, nor is it the voice of crying from defeat, but I hear the sound of singing.” 
32:19 Then it happened, as soon as Moses came near the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing, and his anger burned hot. So he threw the tablets out of his hands, and smashed them at the foot of the mountain. 
32:20  drink it. 
32:21 Then Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you, to make you bring such a great sin upon them?” 
32:22 Aaron said, “Don’t be angry, my lord! You know these people yourself, and how they are set on evil. 
32:23 They said to me, ‘Make gods for us, to go before us! As for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what happened to him.’ 
32:24 So I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let them break it off.’ So they gave it to me and I threw it into the fire—and out came this calf!” 
32:25 When Moses saw that the people were unrestrained, because Aaron had let them run wild, to become a joke among their enemies, 
32:26 ’s side, let him come to me.” Then all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him. 
32:27 , the God of Israel says, ‘Every man put on his sword, and go to and fro, from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay his brother, his friend, and his neighbor.’” 
32:28 So the sons of Levi did as Moses said, and that day from among the people there fell about 3,000 men. 
32:29  so that He may give you a blessing today, for every man has been against his son and his brother.” 
32:30 —perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.” 
32:31  and said, “Alas, these people have sinned greatly, and made gods of gold! 
32:32 Yet now, please forgive their sin. But if not, please blot me out of Your book that You have written.” 
32:33  said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot out of My book. 
32:34 Now go, lead the people to the place that I told you about. My angel will go before you. Nevertheless, on the day when I take account, I will hold them accountable for their sin.” 
32:35  struck the people because of what they did with the calf that Aaron had made.
33:1  said to Moses, “Leave, get out of this place, you and the people that you have brought out of the land of Egypt, into the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob saying, ‘I will give it to your seed.’ 
33:2 I will send an angel before you. I will drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and the Jebusites. 
33:3 Head up into a land flowing with milk and honey, but I will not move within the midst of you, so that I do not destroy you along the way, for you are a stiff-necked people.” 
33:4 When the people heard these dreadful words, they mourned, and no one put on any ornaments. 
33:5 , ‘You are a stiff-necked people. If I were going up among you for one moment, I would consume you. Take off your ornaments, so that I may consider what to do to you.’” 
33:6  stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Horeb onward.
33:7  would go out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp. 
33:8 Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would arise and stand, everyone at the door of his own tent, and look after Moses, until he had gone into the Tent. 
33:9 After Moses entered, the pillar of cloud descended, stood at the door, and He would speak with Moses. 
33:10 When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the Tent, they all rose up and worshipped, every man at the entrance of his own tent. 
33:11  spoke with Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend. Then he would return to the camp, but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, did not leave the Tent. 
33:12  “You say to me, ‘Bring up this people,’ but You have not let me know whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have also found grace in My eyes.’ 
33:13 Now then, I pray, if I have found grace in Your eyes, show me Your ways, so that I may know You, so that I might find favor in Your sight. Consider also that this nation is Your people.” 
33:14 “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest,” He answered. 
33:15 But then he said to Him, “If Your presence does not go with me, don’t let us go up from here! 
33:16 For how would it be known that I or your people have found favor in Your sight? Isn’t it because You go with us, that distinguishes us from all the people on the face of the earth?” 
33:17  answered Moses, “I will also do what you have said, for you have found favor in My sight, and I know you by name.” 
33:18 Then he said, “Please, show me Your glory!” 
33:19  before you. I will be gracious toward whom I will be gracious, and I will show mercy on whom I will be merciful.” 
33:20 But He also said, “You cannot see My face, for no man can see Me and live.” 
33:21  said, “See, a place near Me—you will stand on the rock. 
33:22 While My glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and cover you with My hand, until I have passed by. 
33:23 Then I will take away My hand, and you will see My back, but My face will not be seen.”
34:1  said to Moses, “Carve for yourself two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I will write upon them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. 
34:2 Be ready by the morning, come up to Mount Sinai, and present yourself to Me there on the top of the mountain. 
34:3 No one is to come up with you, and do not let anyone be seen throughout the entire mountain. Even the flocks and herds must not graze in front of that mountain.” 
34:4  had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tablets of stone. 
34:5 .
34:6 , the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth, 
34:7 showing mercy to a thousand generations, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, yet by no means leaving the guilty unpunished, but bringing the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, to the third and fourth generation.” 
34:8 Then Moses quickly bowed his head down to the earth and worshipped. 
34:9  He said, “If now I have found grace in Your eyes, my Lord, let my Lord please go within our midst, even though this is a stiff-necked people. Pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your own inheritance.”
34:10 —for what I am going to do with you will be awesome! 
34:11 Obey what I am commanding you today. Behold, I am going to drive out the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites before you. 
34:12 Watch yourself, and make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, or they will become a snare among you. 
34:13 Instead you must break down their ­altars, smash their pillars and cut down their Asherah poles. 
34:14  is jealous for His Name—He is a jealous God. 
34:15 “See that you do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land. Otherwise when they prostitute themselves with their gods and sacrifice to their gods, someone will invite you, and you will eat from their sacrifice. 
34:16 Do not take their daughters for your sons, for their daughters will prostitute themselves with their own gods, and cause your sons to prostitute themselves with their gods. 
34:17 “You are not to make for yourselves metal gods. 
34:18  , as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Aviv, for in the month Aviv you came out from Egypt. 
34:19 “Every firstborn of the womb is Mine, and from all your cattle you are to sanctify the males, the firstborn of the ox and sheep. 
34:20 A firstborn donkey you are to redeem with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, then you are to break its neck. You must redeem all your firstborn sons. No one should appear before Me empty-handed. 
34:21 “For six days you will work, but on the seventh day you will rest. During plowing time and harvest you must rest. 
34:22 , which is the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, as well as the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year. 
34:23 , God of Israel. 
34:24  your God three times in the year. 
34:25 , nor should the sacrifice of the Passover Festival remain until morning. 
34:26  your God. “You must not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.” 
34:27  said to Moses, “Write these words, for based on these words I have cut a covenant with you and with Israel.” 
34:28  for 40 days and 40 nights, and he did not eat bread or drink water. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant: the Ten Words. 
34:29 Now it happened, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand when he came down from the mountain, that Moses did not know that the skin of his face was radiant, because God had spoken with him. 
34:30  saw Moses, the skin of his face shone in rays, so they were afraid to come near him. 
34:31 But Moses called out to them, so Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke to them. 
34:32  had spoken to him in Mount Sinai. 
34:33 When Moses was done speaking with them, he put a veil over his face. 
34:34  what he was commanded, 
34:35  saw the face of Moses and that the skin of his face glistened. So Moses put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with Him.
35:1  has commanded you to do. 
35:2 . Whoever does any work then will die. 
35:3 Do not kindle a fire in any of your dwellings on Yom Shabbat.” 
35:4  commanded saying: 
35:5 ’s offering: gold, silver and bronze; 
35:6 blue, purple and scarlet cloth; fine linen and goat hair; 
35:7 ram skins dyed red, sealskins and acacia wood; 
35:8 oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense; 
35:9 onyx stones, and setting stones for the ephod and for the breastplate. 
35:10  has commanded, including 
35:11 the Tabernacle, its tent and its covering, its clasps and its boards, its crossbars, its pillars and its bases; 
35:12 the Ark and the poles, the atonement cover and the curtain screen; 
35:13 the table and its poles with all of its utensils, along with the bread of the Presence; 
35:14  for light with its utensils, its lamps and the oil for the light; 
35:15 the altar of incense and its poles, the anointing oil, the sweet incense, and the screen for the entrance of the Tabernacle; 
35:16 the altar of burnt offering with its grating of bronze, its poles and all its utensils, the basin and its stand; 
35:17 the hangings of the courtyard, the pillars and their bases, and the curtain for the gate of the courtyard; 
35:18 the pegs of the Tabernacle and of the courtyard, along with their cords; 
35:19 .” 
35:20  departed from before Moses. 
35:21 ’s offering for the work of the Tent of Meeting and for all its service as well as for the holy garments. 
35:22 . 
35:23 Everyone who had blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goat hair, ram skins dyed red or sealskins brought them. 
35:24 ’s offering, and every man who had acacia wood of any use for service brought it. 
35:25 Also all the women who were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought what they had woven—the blue, purple, scarlet and fine linen. 
35:26 All the women whose heart stirred them up with wisdom spun the goat hair. 
35:27 Also the leaders brought onyx stones and setting stones for the ephod and for the breastplate, 
35:28 along with the spice, the oil for the light and for anointing and for the sweet incense. 
35:29 . 
35:30  has called by name Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 
35:31  of God, with wisdom, understanding and knowledge, in all manner of craftsmanship, 
35:32 to make ingenious designs, to work in gold, silver and bronze, 
35:33 as well as cutting gemstones for setting, wood carving, to make all kinds of skillful craftsmanship. 
35:34 He has also placed in his heart the ability to teach—both he and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
35:35 He has filled them with wisdom of heart to forge all the works of an engraver, an artisan, and an embroiderer in blue, purple, scarlet and in fine linen, as well as weaving—they can perform every craft and ingenious designs.

36:2  had set wisdom, along with everyone whose heart stirred him up to come do the work. 
36:3  had brought for the work of the service of the Sanctuary, to build it. They brought freewill offerings to him morning after morning. 
36:4 Then all the skilled men who were doing all the work of the Sanctuary came, one by one from the work he was doing, 
36:5  has commanded to be done.” 
36:6 So Moses gave an order, and they proclaimed it throughout the camp saying, “Let neither man nor woman make anything else as an offering for the Sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing more. 
36:7 For the work material they had was sufficient for all the work, with much left over. 
36:8 —the work of a skillful craftsman. 
36:9 The length of each curtain was 28 cubits and the width of each curtain was four cubits. All the curtains had one measure. 
36:10 Then he coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he also coupled together. 
36:11 He made blue loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost within the first set. He did the same along the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second set. 
36:12 He made 50 loops in one curtain and 50 loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set, so that the loops were opposite to one another. 
36:13 Also he made 50 clasps of gold and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps, so the Tabernacle was one. 
36:14 Then he made curtains from goat hair for a tent over the Tabernacle. He made 11 curtains. 
36:15 The length of each curtain was 30 cubits, and the width of each was four cubits. The 11 curtains had one measure. 
36:16 He coupled five curtains by themselves, and six other curtains by themselves.

36:21 The length of a board was ten cubits, the width was a cubit and a half. 
36:22 Each board had two supports, joined one to another. He did this for all the boards of the Tabernacle. 
36:23 So he built the boards for the Tabernacle, 20 boards from the south side southward. 
36:24 And he made 40 silver bases under the 20 boards, two bases under one board for its two supports, and two bases under another board for its two supports.

36:26 along with their 40 silver bases, two under one board and two under the next. 
36:27 For the back part of the Tabernacle westward he made six boards. 
36:28 He also made two boards for the corners of the Tabernacle in the back, 
36:29 so that they could be doubled underneath, and in same way to be fixed to the top, at the first ring. He did this for both of them at the two corners. 
36:30 So there were eight boards, along with their silver bases, 16 in all, two under each board. 
36:31 Then he made crossbars from acacia wood, five for the boards on one side of the Tabernacle, 
36:32 five for the boards on the other side of the Tabernacle, and five crossbars for the boards of the Tabernacle for the back part, westward. 
36:33 He built the middle crossbar to pass through, in the center of the boards, from one end to the other.

37:13 He cast four golden rings for it, and put the rings into the four corners that were on the four feet. 
37:14 The rings were close to the borders, as holders for the poles to carry the table. 
37:15 He also made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table. 
37:16 He forged the articles that were on the table, the dishes, pans, bowls and jars, with which to pour, out of pure gold. 
37:17  of pure gold, of hammered work, even its base, its stem, its cups, its bulbs and its flowers, were one piece with it.

37:21 with a bulb under two branches of one piece, a second bulb under two branches of another piece, and a bulb under two branches of a third piece, for six branches extending out of it. 
37:22 Their bulbs and their branches were one piece with it, an entire hammered work of pure gold.

38:5 He cast four rings for the four ends of the bronze grating, to be holders for the poles. 
38:6 He made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with bronze. 
38:7 Then he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar to carry it, and he made it hollow, out of boards. 
38:8 He made the basin and the base from bronze, with mirrors from the women who served at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.

38:23 Along with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan, a craftsman, a skillful workman, and a weaver of colors, in blue, purple, scarlet and fine linen. 
38:24 The entirety of the gold that was used for the work of the Sanctuary, including the gold of the offering, was 29 talents and 730 shekels, according to the Sanctuary shekel. 
38:25 The silver from those numbered from the congregation was 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the Sanctuary shekel—

39:1  commanded Moses. 
39:2 He made the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet and finely twisted linen. 
39:3 They hammered the gold into thin plates, and cut it into threads, to work it in with the blue, purple and scarlet, within the fine linen, the work of a skillful craftsman. 
39:4 Then they made shoulder pieces for it, joined together at the two ends. 
39:5  commanded Moses. 
39:6 . 
39:7  commanded Moses. 
39:8 He made the breastplate, the work of a skillful craftsman, like the work of the ephod, of gold, blue, purple, scarlet and finely twisted linen. 
39:9 It was square and folded doubled, a span long and a span wide. 
39:10 They mounted within it four rows of stones. A row of ruby, topaz and emerald were the first row. 
39:11 In the second row were a turquoise, a sapphire and a diamond. 
39:12 In the third row were a jacinth, an agate and an amethyst, 
39:13 and in the fourth row were a beryl, an onyx and a jasper. They were enclosed in fittings of gold within their settings. 
39:14 , like the engravings of a signet seal, each one according to its name for the twelve tribes. 
39:15 They attached braided chains to the breastplate, of wreathed work from pure gold. 
39:16 They made two settings of gold, and two golden rings, and set the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. 
39:17 They attached the two golden chains to the two rings at the ends of the breastplate. 
39:18 The other two ends of the chains they placed on the two settings, and fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, in the front. 
39:19 They also made two golden rings, and set them on the two ends of the breastplate, on the edge that was toward the side of the ephod facing inward. 
39:20 They made two more rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder pieces of the ephod underneath, in the front, enclosed by their coupling, above the artfully woven band of the ephod. 
39:21  commanded Moses. 
39:22 He also made the robe of the ephod from woven work, all of blue, 
39:23 with a hole in the center of the robe, and a binding woven around the hole as a collar, so that it would not be torn. 
39:24 They also made, on the hem of the robe, pomegranates of blue, purple, scarlet and twisted linen. 
39:25 Then they made bells of pure gold and put the bells between the pomegranates on the hem of the robe all around, between the pomegranates,

39:27 Then they made the sashes of fine linen, woven work for Aaron and for his sons,

39:30 . 
39:31  commanded Moses. 
39:32  had commanded Moses—they did it just so. 
39:33 Then they brought the Tabernacle to Moses, along with the tent and all of its furnishings, its clasps, its boards, its crossbars, its pillars, and its bases; 
39:34 along with the covering of ram skins dyed red, and the covering of sealskins, the veil of the curtain; 
39:35 as well as the Ark of the Testimony with its poles, and the atonement cover; 
39:36 the table and all of its utensils, the showbread; 
39:37  with its lamps to be set in order, along with all of its utensils, and oil for the light; 
39:38 the golden altar, the anointing oil, the sweet incense, and the curtain for the entrance of the tent; 
39:39 the bronze altar, its grating and its poles along with all of its utensils, and the basin and its base; 
39:40 the hangings for the courtyard, with its pillars, its bases and the curtain for the gate of the courtyard, with its cords and its pegs, along with all the instruments for the service of the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting; 
39:41 . 
39:42  had done all the work just so. 
39:43  had commanded, Moses blessed them.
40:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
40:2 “On the first day of the first month, you will set up the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. 
40:3 You are to put the Ark of the Testimony there, and screen off the Ark with the curtain. 
40:4  and light its lamps. 
40:5 Set the golden incense altar in front of the Ark of the Testimony, and hang the curtain over the entrance of the Tabernacle. 
40:6 “Set the altar of burnt offering before the entrance of the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting. 
40:7 Set up the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it. 
40:8 Set up the courtyard all around, and hang the curtain of the gate of the courtyard. 
40:9 “Take the anointing oil and anoint the Tabernacle, and everything within it, and consecrate it, along with all of its furnishings, and it will be holy. 
40:10 Also you are to anoint the altar of burnt offering with all of its utensils and consecrate the altar. The altar will be most holy. 
40:11 Then you are to anoint the basin along with its base and sanctify it. 
40:12 “Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and wash them with water. 
40:13 . 
40:14 Also bring his sons and put tunics upon them. 
40:15 . Their anointing will be for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.” 
40:16  had commanded him. 
40:17 Now it happened during the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, the Tabernacle was raised up. 
40:18 Moses raised the Tabernacle, and laid its bases, set up the framework of boards, put in the crossbars and set up its pillars. 
40:19  had commanded Moses. 
40:20 He placed the Testimony into the Ark, set the poles on the Ark, and put the atonement cover on top of the Ark. 
40:21  had commanded Moses. 
40:22 Then he set up the table inside the Tent of Meeting, on the side of the Tabernacle northward, outside the curtain. 
40:23  had commanded Moses. 
40:24  in the Tent of Meeting, over against the table, on the south side of the Tabernacle. 
40:25  had commanded Moses. 
40:26 Next he placed the golden altar in the Tent of Meeting before the curtain, 
40:27  had commanded Moses. 
40:28 He hung the curtain over the entrance of the Tabernacle. 
40:29  had commanded Moses. 
40:30 Next he set up the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing, 
40:31 so that Moses, Aaron and his sons could wash their hands and their feet there. 
40:32  had commanded Moses. 
40:33 He set up the courtyard around the Tabernacle and the altar and set up the screen at the gate of the courtyard. So Moses finished the work.
40:34  filled the Tabernacle. 
40:35  filled the Tabernacle. 
40:36  went onward, throughout all their journeys. 
40:37 But if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not move out until the day that it was. 
40:38  was on the Tabernacle by day and a fire was there by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys.
