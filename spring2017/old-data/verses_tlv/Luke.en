1:1 Now many have undertaken to organize an account of the events fulfilled among us, 
1:2 just as they were handed down to us from the start by the eyewitnesses and reporters of the word. 
1:3 Therefore it seemed best to me also, because I have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, to write for you an orderly record, most excellent Theophilus, 
1:4 so you may know for sure the truth of the words you have been taught.
1:5  named Zechariah from the priestly division of Abijah. Elizabeth, his wife, was from the daughters of Aaron. 
1:6 , walking without fault in all His commandments and instructions. 
1:7 But they were childless, because Elizabeth was barren and both of them were elderly. 
1:8  in the order of his division. 
1:9  to burn incense. 
1:10 And the whole crowd of people was praying outside at the hour of incense burning. 
1:11  appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. 
1:12 Zechariah was in turmoil when he saw the angel, and fear fell upon him. 
1:13 But the angel said, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife, Elizabeth, will give birth to your son, and you will name him John. 
1:14 And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. 
1:15  just out of his mother’s womb. 
1:16  their God. 
1:17  a prepared people. 
1:18 Zechariah said to the angel, “How will I know this for certain? I’m an old man, and my wife is well-advanced in age.” 
1:19 And speaking to him, the angel declared, “I am Gabriel, the one standing in God’s presence. I was commissioned to tell you and proclaim to you this good news. 
1:20 So look, you will be silent and powerless to speak until the day these things happen, since you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their time.” 
1:21 The people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering about his long delay in the Holy Place. 
1:22 But when he came out, he couldn’t speak to them. Then they realized that he had seen a vision in the Holy Place. He was making signs to them but remained mute. 
1:23 When the days of his priestly service had been completed, he went home. 
1:24 After these days, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and hid herself for five months, saying, 
1:25  has done this for me! In these days He looked upon me, to take away my disgrace among the people.”
1:26  into a town in the Galilee named Natzeret 
1:27 and to a virgin engaged to a man named Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Miriam. 
1:28  is with you.” 
1:29 But at the message, she was perplexed and kept wondering what kind of greeting this might be. 
1:30 The angel spoke to her, “Do not be afraid, Miriam, for you have found favor with God. 
1:31 . 
1:32  will give Him the throne of David, His father. 
1:33 He shall reign over the house of Jacob for all eternity, and His kingdom will be without end.” 
1:34 Miriam said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am not intimate with a man?” 
1:35 . 
1:36 Behold, even your relative Elizabeth has conceived a son in her old age; and the one who was called barren is six months pregnant. 
1:37 For nothing will be impossible with God.” 
1:38 . Let it be done to me according to your word.” And the angel left her.
1:39 Now in those days, Miriam got up and quickly traveled into the hill country, to a town in Judah. 
1:40 She entered Zechariah’s home and happily greeted Elizabeth. 
1:41 . 
1:42 She then cried out with a great shout, saying, “You are blessed among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. 
1:43 Who am I, that the mother of my Master should come to me? 
1:44 For even when I just heard the sound of your greeting in my ear, the unborn child leaped with joy in my womb. 
1:45 .” 
1:46 , 
1:47 and my spirit greatly rejoices in God, my Savior. 
1:48 For He has looked with care upon the humble state of His maidservant. For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed. 
1:49 For the Mighty One has done a great thing for me, and holy is His name. 
1:50 And His mercy is from generation to generation to the ones who fear Him. 
1:51 He has displayed power with His arm. He has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts. 
1:52 He has brought down rulers from thrones and exalted humble ones. 
1:53 He has filled the hungry with good things and sent away the rich empty-handed. 
1:54 He has helped His servant Israel, remembering His mercy, 
1:55 just as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.”
1:56 Miriam stayed with her for three months and then returned to her home. 
1:57 Upon Elizabeth’s full term to deliver, she gave birth to a son. 
1:58  had shown her His great mercy, and they began to rejoice with her. 
1:59 Now on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they kept trying to call him by his father’s name, Zechariah. 
1:60 But his mother declared, “No, he will be called John.” 
1:61 But they said to her, “No one among your relatives is called by this name.” 
1:62 So they began making signs to his father, as to what he wanted him named. 
1:63 Asking for a small tablet, he wrote, “John is his name.” They were all astonished! 
1:64 And his mouth was immediately unlocked as well as his tongue, and he began to speak, praising God. 
1:65 Fear came on all those who lived around them, and all these matters were talked about throughout the hill country of Judah. 
1:66  was on him. 
1:67  and prophesied, saying, 
1:68 , God of Israel, for He has looked after His people and brought them redemption. 
1:69 He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David, 
1:70 just as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ages past, 
1:71 salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us! 
1:72 So He shows mercy to our fathers and remembers His holy covenant, 
1:73 the vow which He swore to Abraham our father, to grant us— 
1:74 rescued fearlessly from the hand of our enemies—to serve Him, 
1:75 in holiness and righteousness before Him all our days. 
1:76  to prepare His ways, 
1:77 to give knowledge of salvation to His people through removal of their sins. 
1:78 Through our God’s heart of mercy, the Sunrise from on high will come upon us, 
1:79 .” 
1:80 And the child kept growing and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.
2:1 Now it happened in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus to register all the world’s inhabitants. 
2:2 This was the first census taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria. 
2:3 Everyone was traveling to be registered in his own city. 
2:4 Now Joseph also went up from the Galilee, out of the town of Natzeret to Judah, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was from the house and family of David. 
2:5 He went to register with Miriam, who was engaged to him and was pregnant. 
2:6 But while they were there, the time came for her to give birth— 
2:7 and she gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped Him in strips of cloth and set Him down in a manger, since there was no room for them in the inn.
2:8 Now there were shepherds in the same region, living out in the fields and guarding their flock at night. 
2:9  shone all around them; and they were absolutely terrified. 
2:10 But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid! For behold, I proclaim Good News to you, which will be great joy to all the people. 
2:11 A Savior is born to you today in the city of David, who is Messiah the Lord. 
2:12 And the sign to you is this: You will find an infant wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.” 
2:13 And suddenly a multitude of heavenly armies appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, 
2:14  to men of good will.” 
2:15  has made known to us!” 
2:16 So they hurried off and found Miriam and Joseph, and the Baby lying in the manger. 
2:17 When they had seen this, they made known the word that had been spoken to them concerning this Child. 
2:18 And all those who heard were amazed at the things the shepherds told them. 
2:19 But Miriam treasured all these things, pondering them in her heart. 
2:20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, just as they had been told.
2:21 , the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb. 
2:22 . 
2:23 .” 
2:24 : “a pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.” 
2:25  was on him. 
2:26 . 
2:27 , 
2:28  to God, saying, 
2:29 “Now may You let Your servant go in peace, O Sovereign Master, according to Your word. 
2:30 For my eyes have seen Your salvation, 
2:31 which You have prepared in the presence of all peoples: 
2:32 ‘A light for revelation to the nations’ and the glory of Your people Israel.” 
2:33 And His father and mother were marveling at the things that were said about Him. 
2:34  over them and said to Miriam His mother, “Behold, this One is destined to cause the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign that is opposed, 
2:35 so the thoughts of many hearts may be uncovered. (And even for you, a sword will pierce through your soul.)” 
2:36 Now Anna, a daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher, was a prophetess. She was well advanced in age, having lived with a husband only seven years 
2:37 and then as a widow until age eighty-four. She never left the Temple, serving night and day with fasting and prayers. 
2:38 And coming up at that very instant, she began praising God and speaking about the Child to all those waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem. 
2:39 , they returned to the Galilee, to their own city of Natzeret. 
2:40 The Child kept growing and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon Him. 
2:41 Now His parents were going every year to Jerusalem for the Passover feast. 
2:42 When He became twelve years old, they were going up according to festival custom. 
2:43  remained in Jerusalem, but His parents didn’t know. 
2:44 Supposing He was in the caravan, they went a day’s journey, then began looking for Him among relatives and friends. 
2:45 When they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for Him. 
2:46 After three days they found Him in the Temple, sitting in the center of the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. 
2:47 And all those hearing Him were astonished at His understanding and His answers. 
2:48 , they were overwhelmed. And His mother said to Him, “Child, why did you do this to us? Look! Your father and I were searching for You frantically!” 
2:49 He said to them, “Why were you searching for Me? Didn’t you know that I must be about the things of My Father?” 
2:50 But they did not grasp the message He was telling them. 
2:51 Then He went down with them to Natzeret and was obedient to them. But His mother treasured all these words in her heart. 
2:52  kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men. 
3:1 It was now the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of the Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene. 
3:2 During the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came upon John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness. 
3:3 And he came into all the surrounding region of the Jordan, proclaiming an immersion of repentance for the removal of sins. 
3:4 , and make His paths straight. 
3:5 Every valley shall be filled up and every mountain and hill brought low. The crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways made smooth, 
3:6 and all humanity shall see the salvation of God.’” 
3:7 Therefore John was saying to the crowds that came out to be immersed by him, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 
3:8 Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance; and don’t even begin to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father’! For I tell you that from these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. 
3:9 Even now the axe is laid at the root of the trees, so every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire!” 
3:10 The crowds were asking him, “What should we do?” 
3:11 He answered them, saying, “Whoever has two coats, let him give to the one who has none; and whoever has food, let him do the same.” 
3:12 Tax collectors also came to him to be immersed. “Teacher,” they said to him, “what should we do?” 
3:13 He said to them, “Do not take more than you are supposed to.” 
3:14 Also soldiers asked him, saying, “And what should we do?” He said to them, “Do not take things from anyone by force, do not falsely accuse anyone, and be content with your wages.” 
3:15 Now the people were filled with expectation, and all were wondering in their hearts about John, whether he might be the Messiah. 
3:16  and fire. 
3:17 His winnowing fork is in His hand to clear His threshing floor and gather the wheat into His barn, but the chaff He will burn up with inextinguishable fire.” 
3:18 So with many other exhortations, John proclaimed Good News to the people. 
3:19 But Herod the tetrarch—after being rebuked by John because of Herodias, his brother’s wife, and because of all the evil things Herod had done—
3:20 added even this on top of them all: he shut up John in prison. 
3:21  also was immersed. And while He was praying, heaven was opened 
3:22  came down upon Him in bodily form like a dove. And from out of heaven came a voice, “You are My Son, whom I love—with You I am well pleased!”
3:23  was about thirty years old when He began his ministry. He was the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, 
3:24 the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melki, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, 
3:25 the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, 
3:26 the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, 
3:27 the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, 
3:28 the son of Melki, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, 
3:29 the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, 
3:30 the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, 
3:31 the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, 
3:32 the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon, 
3:33 the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, 
3:34 the son of Jacob, the son of Yitzhak, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, 
3:35 the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, 
3:36 the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, 
3:37 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Kenan, 
3:38 the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
4:1  in the wilderness 
4:2 for forty days, being tested by the devil. Now He ate nothing during those days, and when they had ended, He was hungry. 
4:3 , tell this stone to become bread.” 
4:4  answered him, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone.’” 
4:5 And leading Him up, the devil showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant. 
4:6 And the devil said to Him, “I’ll give to You all this authority along with its glory, because it has been handed over to me and I can give it to anyone I wish. 
4:7 Therefore, if you will worship before me, all this shall be Yours.” 
4:8  your God, and Him only shall you serve.’” 
4:9 , throw Yourself down from here. 
4:10 For it is written, ‘He will command His angels concerning you, to guard you,’ 
4:11 and ‘upon their hands they will lift you up, so that you may not strike your foot against a stone.’” 
4:12  your God to the test.’” 
4:13 And when the devil had completed every test, he departed from Him until another occasion.
4:14  to the Galilee, and news about Him went out through all the surrounding region. 
4:15 He taught in their synagogues, and everyone was praising Him. 
4:16 And He came to Natzeret, where He had been raised. As was His custom, He went into the synagogue on Shabbat, and He got up to read. 
4:17 When the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him, He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written, 
4:18  is on me, because He has anointed me to proclaim Good News to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set free the oppressed, 
4:19 ’s favor.” 
4:20 He closed the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. All eyes in the synagogue were focused on Him. 
4:21 Then He began to tell them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your ears.” 
4:22 All were speaking well of Him and marveling at the gracious words coming out of His mouth. And they were saying, “Isn’t this the son of Joseph?” 
4:23 But He said to them, “Doubtless you will say to Me this proverb, ‘Doctor, heal yourself!’ and ‘What we have heard was done at Capernaum, do as much here also in your hometown.’” 
4:24 But He said, “Truly, I tell you, ‘No prophet is accepted in his own hometown.’ 
4:25 But with all truthfulness I say to you, that there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when heaven was closed for three and a half years and there came a great famine over all the land. 
4:26 Elijah was not sent to any of them, but only to Zarephath in the land of Sidon, to a widowed woman. 
4:27  in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them were purified apart from Naaman the Syrian.” 
4:28 Now all in the synagogue were filled with rage upon hearing these things. 
4:29 Rising up, they drove Him out of the town and brought Him as far as the edge of the mountain on which their city had been built, in order to throw Him off the cliff. 
4:30 But passing through the middle of them, He went on His way. 
4:31  came down to Capernaum, a town in the Galilee. He was teaching them on Shabbat, 
4:32 and they were astounded at His teaching because His message had authority. 
4:33 In the synagogue was a man who had an unclean demonic spirit, and he cried out with a loud voice, 
4:34  of Natzeret? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are! You are the Holy One of God!” 
4:35  rebuked him, saying, “Quiet! Come out of him!” And when the demon threw him down in their midst, it came out without hurting him. 
4:36 They were all amazed, and they spoke to one another, saying, “What is this message? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.” 
4:37 So His reputation grew, spreading to every place in that region. 
4:38  entered Simon’s home. Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they petitioned Him concerning her. 
4:39 Then standing over her, He rebuked the fever and it left her. Immediately she arose to wait on them. 
4:40  all who were sick with various diseases. And He was laying hands on each one and healing them. 
4:41 !” But He was rebuking them and not permitting them to speak, because they knew Him to be the Messiah. 
4:42 Now when it was day, He left and went to a desert place. The crowds were searching for Him, and they came to Him and were trying to keep Him from leaving them. 
4:43 But He said to them, “I must proclaim the Good News of the kingdom of God to the other towns also. It was for this purpose I was sent.” 
4:44 So He kept preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
5:1 , 
5:2 when He saw two boats standing beside the lake. Now the fishermen had left them and were washing the nets. 
5:3  asked him to push out a ways from the land. Then sitting down, He taught the crowds from the boat. 
5:4 When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, “Go out into the deep water, and let down your nets for a catch.” 
5:5 Simon replied, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and caught nothing. But at Your word I will let down the nets.” 
5:6 When they had done this, they caught so many fish that their nets began to break. 
5:7 So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink. 
5:8 ’s knees, saying, “Go away from me, Master, for I am a sinful man!” 
5:9 For amazement had gripped him and all who were with him, over the catch of fish they had netted; 
5:10  said to Simon, “Do not be afraid. From now on, you will be catching men.” 
5:11 So when they had brought the boats to the landing, they left everything and followed Him. 
5:12 , he fell on his face and begged Him, saying, “Master, if You are willing, You can make me clean.” 
5:13  left him. 
5:14 . Then bring an offering for your cleansing, just as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.” 
5:15  was spreading all the more, and many crowds were coming together to hear and to be healed of their diseases. 
5:16 Yet He would often slip away into the wilderness and pray.
5:17 ’s power to heal was in Him. 
5:18 . 
5:19 . 
5:20 When He saw their faith, He said, “Man, your sins are forgiven.” 
5:21  scholars and the Pharisees began to question, saying, “Who is this fellow speaking blasphemies? Who can pardon sins but God alone?” 
5:22 , knowing their thoughts, replied to them, “Why are you raising questions in your hearts? 
5:23 Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’? 
5:24 But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins….” He said to the paralyzed one, “I tell you, get up and take your cot, and go home!” 
5:25 Immediately he got up before them, picked up what he had been lying on, and went home, glorifying God. 
5:26 Astonishment took hold of them, and they glorified God and all were filled with awe, saying, “We’ve seen incredible things today!”
5:27  went out and observed a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax booth. He said to him, “Follow Me.” 
5:28 And leaving everything, he got up and followed Him. 
5:29  at his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them. 
5:30  scholars began murmuring to His disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” 
5:31  answered and said to them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a doctor, but those who are sick do. 
5:32 I did not come to call the righteous, but the sinful to repentance.” 
5:33 But they said to Him, “John’s disciples often fast and offer prayers, as do the disciples of the Pharisees. But Your disciples are eating and drinking.” 
5:34  said to them, “You cannot make the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you? 
5:35 But the days will come; and when the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will fast in those days.” 
5:36 Now he was also telling them a parable. “No one tears a patch from a new garment to use it on an old garment. Otherwise he will rip the new, and the patch from the new will not match the old. 
5:37 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins, it will be spilled out, and the skins will be destroyed. 
5:38 But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. 
5:39 No man who drinks old wine wants new, because he says, ‘The old is fine.’”
6:1  was passing through grain fields; and His disciples were picking and eating heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands. 
6:2 But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not permitted on Shabbat?” 
6:3  said, “Haven’t you read what David did when he was hungry, and those with him? 
6:4  are permitted to eat, and even gave it to those with him?” 
6:5 He said to them, “The Son of Man is Lord of Shabbat.” 
6:6  entered the synagogue and was teaching. A man was there, whose right hand was paralyzed. 
6:7  scholars and Pharisees, to see if He heals on Shabbat, so that they might find grounds to accuse Him. 
6:8 But He knew their opinions and said to the man with the paralyzed hand, “Get up and stand in our midst.” And getting up, the man stood. 
6:9  to do good or to do evil, to save or to destroy a life?” 
6:10 Then looking around at everyone, He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” The man did, and his hand was restored. 
6:11 .
6:12  went out to the mountain to pray, and He spent all night in prayer to God. 
6:13 When day came, He called His disciples, choosing from among them twelve whom He also named emissaries—
6:14 Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; and Jacob and John; and Philip and Bartholomew; 
6:15 and Matthew and Thomas; Jacob the son of Alphaeus; Simon who was called the Zealot; 
6:16 Judah the son of Jacob; and Judah from Kriot, who became a traitor.
6:17  came down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of His disciples and a multitude of people, from all Judea, Jerusalem, and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon, 
6:18 had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases. Even those disturbed by defiling spirits were being healed. 
6:19 Everyone in the crowd was trying to touch Him, because power flowed from Him and He was healing them all. 
6:20 And looking up at His disciples, He said, “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. 
6:21 Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh. 
6:22 Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, and revile you, and spurn your name as evil on account of the Son of Man. 
6:23 Rejoice in that day and jump for joy! For behold, your reward is great in heaven! For their fathers used to treat the prophets the same way.” 
6:24 But woe to you who are rich, for you are receiving your comfort in full. 
6:25 Woe to you who are full, for you shall be hungry. Woe to you who are laughing now, for you shall mourn and weep. 
6:26 Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for their fathers used to treat the false prophets the same way.” 
6:27 “But I say to you who are listening: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 
6:28 bless those who curse you, pray for the ones who mistreat you. 
6:29 To the one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also. And from the one who takes your cloak, do not hold back your shirt. 
6:30 Give to every one who asks you; and whoever takes something of yours, make no demands upon him. 
6:31 “Do to others as you would have them do to you. 
6:32 If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. 
6:33 And if you do good to those who are doing good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do this. 
6:34 And if you lend to those from whom you expect to take, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same. 
6:35 “But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return. Then your reward will be great and you will be sons of Elyon, for He is kind to the ungrateful and evil ones. 
6:36 Be compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate to you.” 
6:37 Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Pardon, and you will be pardoned. 
6:38 Give, and it will be given to you—a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, overflowing, will be given into your lap. For whatever measure you measure out will be measured back to you.” 
6:39 He also spoke this parable to them: “The blind cannot show the way to the blind, can he? Won’t they both fall into a pit? 
6:40 A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher. 
6:41 “Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the beam in your own eye? 
6:42 How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take out the speck in your eye,’ when you yourself do not see the beam in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly the speck in your brother’s eye, to take it out.” 
6:43 “For there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit, nor again does a rotten tree produce good fruit. 
6:44 Each tree comes to be known by its own fruit. For figs are not gleaned out of briars; neither are bunches of grapes gathered from thorn bushes. 
6:45 “Out of the good treasure of his heart the good man brings forth good, and out of evil the evil man brings forth evil. For from the overflow of the heart his mouth speaks.” 
6:46 “Why do you call Me ‘Master, Master’ and do not do what I say? 
6:47 Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and does them, I will show you what he is like. 
6:48 He is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock. And when a flood came, the torrent burst against that house but could not shake it, because it had been well built. 
6:49 “But the one who hears yet does not do is like a man who built a house upon land without a foundation. When the torrent burst against it, immediately it collapsed—and the destruction of that house was great!”
7:1  in the hearing of the people, He entered Capernaum. 
7:2 Now a certain centurion had a valued slave, who was ill and about to die. 
7:3 , he sent Jewish elders to Him, asking Him to come and save his slave. 
7:4 , they begged Him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for You to grant this, 
7:5 for he loves our people and even built our synagogue.” 
7:6  started to go with them; and when He wasn’t far from the house, the centurion sent friends to say to Him, “Master, do not trouble Yourself, for I’m not worthy for You to come under my roof. 
7:7 That is why I didn’t consider myself worthy to come to You. But say the word and let my servant be healed. 
7:8 For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.” 
7:9  heard this, He was amazed at him. Turning to the crowd following Him, He said, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.” 
7:10 When those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.
7:11  traveled to a town called Nain, and coming along with Him were His disciples and a large crowd. 
7:12 Just as He came near the town gate, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother, a widow. A considerable crowd from the town was with her. 
7:13 When the Lord saw her, He felt compassion for her and said, “Don’t cry.” 
7:14 Then He came up and touched the coffin, and the pallbearers came to a standstill. He said, “Young man! I tell you, get up!” 
7:15  gave him to his mother. 
7:16 Fear took hold of them all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has appeared among us, and God has visited His people.” 
7:17 This report concerning Him spread throughout all Judea and the surrounding region.
7:18 John’s disciples reported to him about all these things. Calling two of his disciples, 
7:19 John sent them to the Lord, saying, “Are you the One who is to come, or should we look for another?” 
7:20 When they appeared before Him, the men said, “John the Immerser sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you the One who is to come, or shall we look for another?’” 
7:21 At this very hour He was healing many of diseases, sicknesses, and evil spirits; and He granted sight to many who were blind. 
7:22  are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news proclaimed to them. 
7:23 Blessed is he who is not led to stumble because of Me.” 
7:24 And after John’s messengers left, He began to speak about John to the crowds. “What did you go out to the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 
7:25 No? So what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine garments? Look, those who wear finery and live in luxury are in the palaces of kings! 
7:26 Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, even more than a prophet. 
7:27 This is the one about whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send My messenger before You, who will prepare Your way before You.’ 
7:28 I say to you, there is no one greater than John among those born of women; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.” 
7:29 And when all the people heard, even the tax collectors, they affirmed God’s justice, because they had been immersed with John’s immersion. 
7:30  lawyers, not having been immersed by John, declared God’s purpose invalid for themselves. 
7:31 “So then, to what shall I compare the people of this generation? What are they like? 
7:32 They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to each other, saying, ‘We played the flute for you, and you didn’t dance. We sang a dirge, and you didn’t weep.’ 
7:33 “For John the Immerser has come not eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’ 
7:34 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking. and you say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ 
7:35 Yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children.” 
7:36  if He would eat with him. Upon entering the Pharisee’s home, He reclined at the table. 
7:37  was reclining at the Pharisee’s home, brought an alabaster jar of perfume. 
7:38 As she stood behind Him at His feet, weeping, she began to drench His feet with tears and kept wiping them with her head of hair. Then she was kissing His feet and anointing them with perfume. 
7:39 Now when the Pharisee who invited Him saw this, he said to himself, “If this were a prophet, He would know what sort of woman is touching Him—that she’s a sinner.” 
7:40  said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” And he said, “Say it, Teacher!” 
7:41 “A moneylender had two debtors. One owed him five hundred denarii, but the other fifty. 
7:42 When neither could repay him, he canceled both debts. So which of them will love him more?” 
7:43  said. 
7:44 Turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you didn’t give Me water for My feet. But she has drenched My feet with tears and wiped them with her hair. 
7:45 You didn’t greet Me with a kiss; but from the time she entered, she has not stopped kissing My feet. 
7:46 You didn’t anoint My head with oil, but she has anointed My feet with perfume. 
7:47 For this reason I tell you, her sins, which are many, have been forgiven—for she loved much. But the one who is forgiven little, loves little. 
7:48 He then said to her, “Your sins have been forgiven.” 
7:49 But those who were reclining at table with Him began to say to one another, “Who is this, who even forgives sins?” 
7:50 .”
8:1  began traveling throughout towns and villages, preaching and proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom of God. The twelve were also with Him. 
8:2 And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities — Miriam, the one called Magdalene, out of whom seven demons had gone; 
8:3 Joanna, the wife of Kuza, Herod’s finance minister; Susanna; and many others—were supporting them out of their own resources. 
8:4 And when a large crowd was gathering and those from various towns were traveling to Him, He spoke by means of a parable. 
8:5 “The sower went out to spread his seed. As he sowed, some fell beside the road and was trampled; and the birds of the air ate it up. 
8:6 And other seed fell on rock; when it came up, that seed withered away because it had no moisture. 
8:7 Other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it. 
8:8 And other seed fell into the good soil; and when it came up, it produced fruit a hundredfold.” While saying these things, He would call out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.” 
8:9 Now His disciples were asking Him what this parable meant. 
8:10  said to them, “To you has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to the others it is given in parables, in order that ‘Seeing, they may not see, and hearing, they may not understand.’ 
8:11 “Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God. 
8:12 Those beside the road are the ones who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and be saved. 
8:13 But those on the rocky places are the ones who, when they hear, accept the word with joy. But these have no root; they believe for a season, and in a time of testing fall away. 
8:14 Now that which fell into the thorns are those who were hearing; but as they go along the way, they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and they do not bear mature fruit. 
8:15 But the seed in the good soil are those with a praiseworthy and good heart, who have heard the word and hold it fast and bear fruit with patient endurance. 
8:16 “Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it with some object or places it under a bed. But he puts it on a lampstand so that all those who enter may be able to see the light. 
8:17 For nothing is hidden that will not become evident, nor secret that shall not be known and come into open view. 
8:18 So pay attention how you listen. For whoever has, to him more will be given. And whoever does not have, even what he supposes he has will be taken away from him.” 
8:19 ’s mother and brothers came to Him, but were not able to reach Him through the crowd. 
8:20 Now it was reported to Him, “Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see You.” 
8:21 But answering, He said to them, “My mother and My brothers are these who are hearing the word of God and doing it.”
8:22  and His disciples got into a boat, and He said to them, “Let’s move to the other side of the lake.” So they set out. 
8:23 Then as they were sailing, He fell asleep. A violent windstorm came down on the lake, and they were swamped with water and in danger. 
8:24  and woke Him, saying, “Master, Master, we’re perishing!” He got up and rebuked the wind and the surging wave of water. Then they stopped, and it became calm. 
8:25  said to them, “Where is your faith?” But they were afraid and marveled, saying to one another, “Who then is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him!”
8:26 They sailed over to the country of the Gerasenes, which is on the opposite side of the Galilee. 
8:27  as He was coming out onto the land. The man hadn’t worn any clothing for a long time and was living not in a house but in the tombs. 
8:28 ? I’m begging You, do not torment me!” 
8:29  commanded the defiling spirit to come out of the man. For many times it had seized him so that, even though he was restrained and bound with chains and shackles, he would break the chains and be driven by the demons into the desert. 
8:30  questioned him, “What is your name?” “Legion,” he said, for many demons had entered him. 
8:31 They kept begging Him not to command them to depart into the abyss. 
8:32  to let them enter these pigs, and He gave them permission. 
8:33 Then the demons came out of the man and entered into the pigs. The herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and was drowned. 
8:34 But when the herdsmen saw what happened, they ran away and reported it in the town and countryside. 
8:35 . And they were frightened. 
8:36 Now those who had seen it reported how the demon-plagued man had been restored. 
8:37  to go away from them because they were overcome by great fear. So He got into a boat and returned. 
8:38  sent him away, saying, 
8:39  had done for him. 
8:40  returned, the crowd welcomed Him, for they were all expecting Him. 
8:41 ’s feet, he begged Him to come to his house, 
8:42 because his only daughter, about twelve years old, was dying. But as He made His way, the masses were crushing in upon Him. 
8:43 And there was a woman with a blood flow for twelve years, who could not be healed by anyone. 
8:44 ’s garment. Immediately, her blood flow stopped. 
8:45  said, “Who touched Me?” When everyone denied it, Peter said, “Master, the crowds are surrounding You and pressing in!” 
8:46  said, “Someone touched Me, for I recognized power going out from Me.” 
8:47 Then seeing that she did not escape notice, the woman came trembling and fell prostrate before Him. In the presence of all the people, she confessed why she had touched Him and how she had been healed immediately. 
8:48 .” 
8:49 While He was still speaking, someone comes from the house of the synagogue leader, saying, “Your daughter has died. Don’t bother the Teacher anymore.” 
8:50  replied to him, “Do not fear—just keep trusting, and she shall be restored.” 
8:51  came into the house, He didn’t let anyone enter with Him except Peter, John, Jacob, and the child’s father and mother. 
8:52 And everyone was weeping and lamenting her; but He said, “Don’t weep, for she didn’t die but is sleeping.” 
8:53 But they were ridiculing Him, knowing she had died. 
8:54 , took her by the hand and called out, saying, “Child, get up!” 
8:55  ordered food to be given to her to eat. 
8:56 Her parents were utterly astonished, but He ordered them to say nothing of what had happened.
9:1  called the twelve together, He gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases. 
9:2 He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal. 
9:3 And He said to them, “Take nothing for the journey—no walking stick, no travel bag, no bread, no money, nor even to have two shirts. 
9:4 Whatever house you enter, stay there and depart from there. 
9:5 And whoever does not receive you, when you leave that town, shake off the dust from your feet as a witness against them.” 
9:6 So they went out and began traveling throughout the villages, proclaiming the Good News and healing everywhere. 
9:7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard all that was happening. He was very confused, because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead, 
9:8 but others that Elijah had appeared, and others that some prophet from among the ancients had arisen. 
9:9 But Herod said, “I beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things?” And he kept trying to see Him.
9:10  all they had done. Then He took them along and withdrew privately to a city named Bethsaida. 
9:11  welcomed them and began speaking to them about the kingdom of God and curing those in need of healing. 
9:12 , “Send the crowd away, so they might go into the nearby villages and countryside and find food and lodging; for we are in a desolate place here.” 
9:13  said to them, “You give them something to eat!” But they said, “We have no more than five loaves of bread and two fish, unless we go to buy food for all these people.” 
9:14  said to His disciples, “Have the people recline in groups of about fifty each.” 
9:15 They did so, and all reclined. 
9:16  and broke them. And He kept giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd. 
9:17 Then they all ate and were satisfied. And what was left over was picked up, twelve baskets of the fragments.
9:18  was praying alone and His disciples were near, He put a question to them, saying, “Who do the crowds say that I am?” 
9:19 They replied, “John the Immerser, but others Elijah, and others that some prophet from among the ancients has arisen.” 
9:20 Then He said to them, “But who do you that say I am?” Then Peter answered and said, “The Messiah of God.” 
9:21  warned them, and He ordered them not to tell this to anyone, 
9:22  scholars, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.” 
9:23  was saying to everyone, “If anyone wants to follow Me, he must deny himself, take up his cross every day, and follow Me. 
9:24 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it. 
9:25 “For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself? 
9:26 For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and the glory of the Father and the holy angels. 
9:27 But I tell you truthfully, there are some standing here who will never taste death until they see the kingdom of God.”
9:28  took Peter, John, and Jacob with Him and went up the mountain to pray. 
9:29 While He was praying, the appearance of His face changed, and His clothing flashed like white lightning. 
9:30 And behold, two men were talking with Him, Moses and Elijah. 
9:31 ’s departure, which was about to take place in Jerusalem. 
9:32 ’s glory and the two men standing with Him. 
9:33 , Peter said to Him, “Master, it’s good for us to be here. Let’s make three sukkot: one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah”—not knowing what he was saying. 
9:34 While he was yet saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. 
9:35 Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, the One I have chosen. Listen to Him!” 
9:36  was found alone. They kept quiet and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.
9:37 . 
9:38 Suddenly a man from the crowd shouted out loudly, saying, “Teacher, I’m begging You to look at my son, for he’s my only child! 
9:39 You see, a spirit takes hold of him, and he immediately screams. It throws him into convulsions with frothing. It hardly ever leaves him—it’s crushing him! 
9:40 I begged Your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn’t.” 
9:41  said, “O faithless and twisted generation, how long shall I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.” 
9:42  rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and restored him to his father. 
9:43 And all were amazed at the mighty power of God. But as everyone was marveling at all He was doing, He said to His disciples, 
9:44 “Put these words into your ears: the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.” 
9:45 But they did not understand this statement; it was yet concealed from them so they could not grasp it. And they were afraid to ask Him about this statement. 
9:46 Now a dispute began between the disciples as to who might be the greatest among them. 
9:47 , knowing the reasoning of their heart, took a child and set him by His side. 
9:48 He said to them, “Whoever welcomes this child in My name, welcomes Me. And whoever welcomes Me, welcomes the One who sent Me. The one who is the least among all of you is the one who is great.” 
9:49 John replied, “Master, we saw someone driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him because he doesn’t follow along with us.” 
9:50  said to him, “Do not stop him, for he who is not against you is for you.”
9:51  was determined to go up to Jerusalem. 
9:52 He sent messengers before Him, and they went and entered a Samaritan village to make His arrangements. 
9:53 But they did not receive Him, because He was focused on going up to Jerusalem. 
9:54 When His disciples Jacob and John saw this, they said, “Master, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?” 
9:55  turned and rebuked them. 
9:56 Then they moved on to another village. 
9:57 As they were traveling on the road, someone said to Him, “I will follow You wherever You go.” 
9:58  said to him, “Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.” 
9:59 He said to another, “Follow Me.” But that one said, “First let me go and bury my father.” 
9:60  said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead. But you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.” 
9:61 Then another also said, “I will follow You, Master, but first let me say goodbye to those in my home.” 
9:62  said to him, “No one who has put his hand to the plow and looked back is fit for the kingdom of God.”
10:1 Now after these things, the Lord assigned seventy others and sent them out by twos before Him into every town and place where He Himself was about to go. 
10:2 And He was telling them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore, beg the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest. 
10:3 “Go forth! Look, I am sending you as lambs in the midst of wolves. 
10:4 Do not be burdened with a money belt, travel bag, or shoes; and do not greet anyone along the way. 
10:5  be on this home.” 
10:6  will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you. 
10:7 And remain in this same home, eating and drinking the things they offer, for the worker is deserving of his wage. Do not keep moving from house to house. 
10:8 “Whatever town you enter and they welcome you, eat what they set before you. 
10:9 Then heal the sick in that town, and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’ 
10:10 But if you enter a town and they do not welcome you, then go out into its streets and say, 
10:11 ‘Even the dust of your town sticking to our feet, we wipe off as a witness to you. But know this! The kingdom of God has come near.’ 
10:12 I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom on that day than for that town. 
10:13 “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have turned long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 
10:14 Yet it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the Judgment than for you! 
10:15 . 
10:16 The one who listens to you hears Me, and the one who rejects you rejects Me, and the one who rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me.”
10:17 Then the seventy returned with joy, saying, “Master, even the demons submit to us in Your name!” 
10:18  said to them, “I was watching satan fall like lightning from heaven. 
10:19 Behold, I have given you authority to trample upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you. 
10:20 Nevertheless, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names have been written in the heavens.” 
10:21  and said, “I praise You, Father, Master of the universe, that You have hidden these things from the wise and discerning and revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for this way was pleasing to You. 
10:22 All things have been handed over to Me by My Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.” 
10:23 Then turning to the disciples, He said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see! 
10:24 For I tell you, many prophets and kings desired to see what you are seeing yet did not see, and to hear what you are hearing yet did not hear.”
10:25 , saying, “Teacher, what should I do to gain eternal life?” 
10:26 ? How do you read it?” 
10:27  your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.” 
10:28  said to him, “You have answered correctly. Do this and you will live.” 
10:29 , “Then who is my neighbor?” 
10:30  replied, “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho. He was attacked by robbers, who stripped him and beat him. Then they left, abandoning him as half dead. 
10:31  was going down that road; but when he saw the man, he passed by on the opposite side. 
10:32 Likewise a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the opposite side. 
10:33 But a Samaritan who was traveling came upon him; and when he noticed the man, he felt compassion. 
10:34 He went up to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on olive oil and wine. Then setting him on his own animal, he brought him to a lodge for travelers and took care of him. 
10:35 The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, ‘Take care of him. And whatever else you spend, upon my return I will repay you myself.’ 
10:36 Which of these three seems to you a neighbor to the one attacked by robbers?” 
10:37  said to him, “Go, and you do the same.” 
10:38  entered a certain village; and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her house. 
10:39 She had a sister called Miriam, who was seated at the Master’s feet, listening to His teaching. 
10:40  and said, “Master, doesn’t it concern you that my sister has left me to serve alone? Then tell her to help me!” 
10:41 But answering her, the Lord said, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and bothered about many things; 
10:42 but only one thing is necessary. For Miriam has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her.”
11:1  was praying in a certain place. When He finished, one of His disciples said to Him, “Master, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.” 
11:2  said to them, “When you pray, say, ‘Father, sanctified be Your Name, Your kingdom come. 
11:3 Give us each day our daily bread. 
11:4 And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation.” 
11:5  said to them, “Which of you has a friend and will go to him in the middle of the night and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, 
11:6 because a friend of mine has come to me on his journey and I have nothing to set before him.’ 
11:7 Then from within he may answer, saying, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can’t get up to give you anything.’ 
11:8 I tell you, even if the friend will not get up and give him anything out of friendship, yet because of the man’s persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs. 
11:9 “So I say to you, ‘Ask, and it shall be given to you. Seek, and you shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened to you. 
11:10 For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.’ 
11:11 What father, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? 
11:12 And if he asks for an egg, will he give him a scorpion? 
11:13  to those who ask Him!”
11:14  was driving out a demon, and it was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute one spoke and the crowds were amazed. 
11:15 But some among them said, “By beelzebul, the ruler of demons, He drives out demons.” 
11:16 Others, testing Him, were demanding from Him a sign from heaven. 
11:17 , knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed, and a house against a house falls. 
11:18 Now if satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say by beelzebul I drive out the demons. 
11:19 But if by beelzebul I drive out demons, by whom do your sons drive them out? For this reason, they will be your judges. 
11:20 But if by the finger of God I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come to you. 
11:21 “When a strong one, fully-armed, protects his own estate, his possessions are safe. 
11:22 But as soon as someone stronger than he attacks and overpowers him, then he takes away the armor that he had trusted in and divides up his plunder. 
11:23 He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters. 
11:24 “When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places looking for rest. Not finding any, it says, ‘I will return to my house where I came from.’ 
11:25 And when it comes, it finds the house swept and put in order. 
11:26 Then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and settle there. And that man’s last condition becomes worse than the first.” 
11:27  was saying these things, a certain woman in the crowd, raising her voice, said to Him, “Blessed is the womb that carried You and the breasts that nursed You!” 
11:28 But He said, “Rather, blessed are those who hear the word of God and obey it.” 
11:29  began to say, “This generation is a wicked generation. It demands a sign, yet no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. 
11:30 For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation. 
11:31 The Queen of the South will rise up at the Judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, something greater than Solomon is here. 
11:32 The men of Nineveh will rise at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at Jonah’s proclamation. And indeed, one greater than Jonah is here. 
11:33 “No one lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on the lampstand so that those entering may see the light. 
11:34 Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light. But when it is sick, your body is full of darkness. 
11:35 Therefore, watch out that the light in you is not darkness. 
11:36 If then your body is full of light, with no part of it dark, it will be as full of light as when a lamp gives you light with its gleam.”
11:37  to eat with him, so He entered and sat down. 
11:38  did not do the ritual handwashing before the meal. 
11:39 But the Lord said to him, “You Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and plate, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. 
11:40 Fools! Didn’t He who created the outside also create the inside? 
11:41  those things that are within, and indeed everything is pure to you. 
11:42 “But woe to you Pharisees, for you tithe mint, rue, and every garden herb, yet bypass justice and the love of God. It is necessary to do these things without neglecting the others. 
11:43 Woe to you Pharisees, for you love the best seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces. 
11:44 Woe to you, for you are like unmarked tombs, and people walk over them without knowing.” 
11:45  lawyers says to Him, “Teacher, when You say these things, You insult us too.” 
11:46  lawyers as well, for you weigh the people down with burdens hard to carry, yet you yourselves will not touch the burdens with even a finger. 
11:47 “Woe to you, for you build the tombs of the prophets whom your own fathers killed! 
11:48 So you are witnesses and approve the deeds of your fathers, for indeed they killed them and you are building their tombs. 
11:49 “For this reason also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and emissaries, and some of them they will kill and persecute, 
11:50 so that the blood of the prophets shed since the foundation of the world might be required from this generation— 
11:51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the one who perished between the altar and the house of God. Yes, I tell you, it will be required from this generation.’ 
11:52  lawyers, for you have taken away the key of knowledge. You yourselves did not enter, and you stood in the way of those entering.” 
11:53  scholars and the Pharisees began to be very hostile and to interrogate Him on many issues, 
11:54 plotting against Him to catch Him in His words. 
12:1  of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. 
12:2 There is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known. 
12:3 Therefore, whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in private rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops. 
12:4 “I say to you, My friends, you should not be afraid of those who kill the body, since after this they have nothing more they can do. 
12:5 But I will show you whom you should fear. Fear the One who, after the killing, has authority to cast into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, fear this One! 
12:6 “Aren’t five sparrows being sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God. 
12:7 Indeed, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows. 
12:8 Now I tell you, whoever acknowledges Me before men, the Son of Man also will acknowledge him before the angels of God. 
12:9 But the one who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God. 
12:10  will not be forgiven. 
12:11 And when they bring you to the synagogues, rulers, and authorities, do not worry about how you should defend yourself or what you should say, 
12:12  will teach you at that time what is necessary to say.”
12:13 Then someone from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” 
12:14  said to him, “Man, who made Me a judge or arbitrator over you?” 
12:15 Then He said to them, “Watch out! Be on guard against all kinds of greed, because one’s life does not consist in the abundance of the material goods he possesses.” 
12:16  told them a parable, saying, “The land of a certain rich man produced good crops. 
12:17 And he began thinking to himself, saying, ‘What shall I do? I don’t have a place to store my harvest!’ 
12:18 And he said, ‘Here’s what I’ll do! I’ll tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I’ll store all my grain and my goods. 
12:19 And I’ll say to myself, ’O my soul, you have plenty of goods saved up for many years! So take it easy! Eat, drink, and be merry.”’ 
12:20 But God said to him, ‘You fool! Tonight your soul is being demanded back from you! And what you have prepared, whose will that be?’ 
12:21 So it is with the one who stores up treasure for himself and is not rich in God.” 
12:22  said to His disciples, “So I say to you, do not worry about life, what you will eat; nor about the body, what you will wear. 
12:23 For life is more than food and the body more than clothing. 
12:24 Consider the ravens. They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them. How much more valuable you are than birds! 
12:25 “And which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? 
12:26 So if you cannot do even something very little, why do you worry about other things? 
12:27 Consider the lilies, how they grow. They neither toil nor spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these. 
12:28 But if God so clothes the grass in the field—which is here today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow—then how much more will He clothe you, O you of little faith? 
12:29 “So do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not keep worrying. 
12:30 For all the nations of the world strive after these things. But your Father knows that you need these things. 
12:31 Instead, seek His kingdom, and these things shall be added to you. 
12:32 Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father chose to give you the kingdom. 
12:33 . Make money pouches for yourselves that do not get old—a treasure in the heavens that never runs out, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. 
12:34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 
12:35 “Have your belt strapped on and lamps burning. 
12:36 Be like people waiting for their master to return from a wedding feast, so that when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately. 
12:37 “Happy are those slaves whose master finds them alert when he comes. Amen, I tell you, he will prepare himself and have them recline at table, and will come and serve them. 
12:38 ”And if he comes in the second or even the third watch and finds them so, they will be happy. 
12:39 But understand this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have allowed his house to be broken into. 
12:40 You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you don’t expect.” 
12:41 Then Peter said, “Master, are You telling this parable for us, or for everyone?” 
12:42 And the Lord said, “Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master will put in charge of his servants, to give them their food portion at the proper time? 
12:43 Blessed is that servant whose master finds him so doing when he comes. 
12:44 Truly I tell you, his master will put him in charge of all his possessions. 
12:45 “But if that servant says in his heart, ‘My master is taking a long time to come,’ and he begins to beat the young slave boys and girls and to eat and drink and get drunk, 
12:46 the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know. And he will cut him in two and assign him a place with the unfaithful. 
12:47 “That slave who knew his master’s will but did not prepare or act according to his desire will be harshly whipped. 
12:48 But the one who did not know and did things worthy of a beating will be whipped lightly. From everyone given much, much will be required; and from the one for whom more is provided, all the more they will ask of him. 
12:49 “I came to pour out fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already ablaze! 
12:50 But I have an immersion to endure, and how distressed I am until it is finished! 
12:51  on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division. 
12:52 From now on there will be five in one house in opposition, three against two and two against three. 
12:53 They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.” 
12:54 Then He also was saying to the crowds, “When you see a cloud rising in the west, instantly you say, ‘A rainstorm is coming’—and so it is. 
12:55 And when a south wind is blowing, you say, ‘It will be a scorcher’—and so it is. 
12:56 Hypocrites! The surface of the earth and sky you know how to interpret yet you don’t know how to interpret this present time? 
12:57 Why can’t you judge for yourselves what is right? 
12:58 For while you are going with your accuser to the authorities, make an effort to come to a settlement with him—so he doesn’t drag you before the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer of the court, and the officer of the court throw you into prison. 
12:59 I tell you, you will never get out of there until you have paid back the last little bit.”
13:1  about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 
13:2 He answered and said to them, “Do you suppose that these Galileans are worse sinners than the rest of the Galileans because they have suffered these things? 
13:3 No, I tell you! But unless you repent, you all will perish the same way. 
13:4 “Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and were killed, do you suppose that they are worse sinners than all the people living in Jerusalem? 
13:5 No, I tell you! But unless you repent, you all will perish the same way. 
13:6  began telling this parable: “A man had a fig tree he had planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it and found none. 
13:7 So he said to the gardener, ‘Indeed, for three years I‘ve come searching for fruit on this fig tree and found none. Remove it! Why does it use up the ground?’ 
13:8 “But answering, the gardener said to him, ‘Master, leave it alone for this year also, until I dig around it and apply fertilizer. 
13:9 And if it bears fruit, good. But if not, cut it down.’”
13:10  was teaching in one of the synagogues on Shabbat. 
13:11 And behold, there was a woman with a disabling spirit for eighteen years, bent over and completely unable to stand up straight. 
13:12  saw her, He called out to her and said, “Woman, you are set free from your disability.” 
13:13 Then He laid hands on her, and instantly she stood up straight and began praising God. 
13:14  had healed on Shabbat, started telling the crowd, “There are six days in which work should be done—so come to be healed on those days and not on Yom Shabbat!” 
13:15  doesn’t each of you untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it away to give it drink? 
13:16 So this one, a daughter of Abraham incapacitated by satan for eighteen years, shouldn’t she be set free from this imprisonment on Yom Shabbat?” 
13:17  said these things, all His opponents were put to shame; but the whole crowd was rejoicing at all the glorious things done by Him. 
13:18  was saying, “What is the kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare it? 
13:19 It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and dropped into his own garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.” 
13:20 Again He said, “To what shall I compare the kingdom of God? 
13:21 , which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened. 
13:22 And He continued on His journey through the towns and villages, teaching and making His way to Jerusalem. 
13:23  said to them, 
13:24 “Make every effort to enter through the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able. 
13:25 Once the Master of the household gets up and shuts the door, and you’re standing outside and begin knocking on the door, saying, ‘Master, open up for us,’ then He will say to you, ‘I don’t know where you come from.’ 
13:26 Then you will start to say, ‘We ate and drank in Your company, and You taught in our streets.’ 
13:27 But He will say, ‘I tell you, I don’t know where you come from. Get away from Me, all of you evildoers!’” 
13:28 “There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out. 
13:29 And they will come from the east and west and from the north and south, and they will recline at table in the kingdom of God. 
13:30 And indeed, some are last who shall be first, and some are first who shall be last.”
13:31 , “Get out and leave from here, because Herod wants to kill You!” 
13:32  said to them, “Go and tell that fox, ‘Indeed, I’m driving out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach My goal.’ 
13:33 But I must keep going today and tomorrow because it just can’t be that a prophet would perish outside Jerusalem. 
13:34 “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing. 
13:35 . Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’”
14:1  went into the home of one of the leaders of the Pharisees to eat a meal on Shabbat, they were watching Him closely. 
14:2 And there before Him was a man swollen with fluid. 
14:3  lawyers and the Pharisees, “Is it permitted to heal on Shabbat, or not?” 
14:4  took hold of him and healed him, and He sent him away. 
14:5 Then He said to them, “Which of you, with a son or an ox falling into a well on Yom Shabbat, will not immediately pull him out?” 
14:6 And they could not reply to these things. 
14:7  began telling a parable to those who had been invited, when He noticed how they were choosing the seats of honor. He said to them, 
14:8 “When you are invited by someone to a wedding, don’t take the seat of honor, for someone more highly esteemed than you may have been invited by him. 
14:9 Then the one who invited both of you will come to you and say, ‘Give up this seat.’ And with shame, you would proceed to take the lowest seat. 
14:10 But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest seat so that when the one who invited you comes, he may say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you shall be honored in the presence of all those who are dining with you. 
14:11 For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” 
14:12  was also saying to the one who invited Him, “When you host a luncheon or dinner, don’t invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors. Otherwise they might invite you in return as your payback. 
14:13 But when you host a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind; 
14:14 and you will be blessed, since they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.” 
14:15  said to Him, “Blessed is he who eats bread in the kingdom of God.” 
14:16  said to him, “A certain man was hosting a large banquet, and he invited many. 
14:17 At the time for the banquet, he sent his slave to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, everything is already prepared.’ 
14:18 “But every one of them began to beg off. The first said to him, ‘I bought a farm, and I’m obligated to go out to see it. I’m asking you to have me excused.’ 
14:19 Then another one said, ‘I’ve purchased five teams of oxen, and I’m going to check them out. I’m asking you to have me excused.’ 
14:20 Still another said, ‘I’ve married a wife, so I cannot come.’ 
14:21 “The slave came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house got angry and said to his slave, ‘Quickly go out into the squares and alleys of the city and bring here the poor, the maimed, the blind, and the lame.’ 
14:22 “And the slave said, ‘Master, I have done as you instructed, and still there is room.’ 
14:23 “So the master said to the slave, ‘Go out into the thoroughfares and fenced areas, and press them to come in so my home may be filled. 
14:24 For I tell you, none of those men who were invited will taste my banquet.’” 
14:25 ; and He turned and said to them, 
14:26 “If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters—and yes, even his own life—he cannot be My disciple. 
14:27 Whoever does not carry his own cross and follow Me cannot be My disciple. 
14:28 “For which of you, wanting to build a tower, doesn’t first sit down and figure out the cost, to see if he has enough to finish it? 
14:29 Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and isn’t able to finish everything, all who see it begin to mock him,
14:30 saying, ‘This man began to build and wasn’t able to finish!’ 
14:31 “Or what king, going to make war against another king, won’t first sit down to consider whether he is able with ten thousand to confront the one coming against him with twenty thousand? 
14:32 If not, while the other is still far away, he sends an ambassador and asks for peace. 
14:33 So in the same way, whoever does not renounce all that he has, cannot be My disciple. 
14:34 “Therefore, salt is good; but if the salt should lose its flavor, how shall it be made salty again? 
14:35 It is not suitable for the soil or for a manure heap—it is thrown out. The one who has ears to hear, let him hear.”
15:1 . 
15:2  scholars began to complain, saying, ‘This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.” 
15:3 So He told this parable to them, saying, 
15:4 “Which man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, will not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he finds it? 
15:5 When he has found it, he puts it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 
15:6 And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors and says, ‘Rejoice with me, for I’ve found my sheep that was lost!’ 
15:7 I tell you, in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one repenting sinner than over the ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.” 
15:8 “Or which woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search thoroughly until she finds it? 
15:9 When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I’ve found the coin I had lost!’ 
15:10 In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.” 
15:11  said, “A certain man had two sons, 
15:12 and the younger of them said to the father, ‘Father, give me the share of the property that comes to me.’ So he divided his wealth between them. 
15:13 “Not many days later, the younger son gathered everything and traveled to a far country, and there he squandered his inheritance on wild living. 
15:14 Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine came against that country, and he began to be in need. 
15:15 So he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. 
15:16 And he was longing to fill up on the carob pods the pigs were eating, but no one was giving him any. 
15:17 “But when he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired workers have food overflowing, but here I am dying of hunger! 
15:18 I’ll get up and go to my father, and I’ll say to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your presence. 
15:19 I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired workers. 
15:20 “And he got up and went to his own father. But while he was still far away, his father saw him and felt compassion. He ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. 
15:21 Then the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your presence. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ 
15:22 “But the father said to his slaves, ‘Quick! Bring out the best robe and put it on him! Put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. 
15:23 Bring the fattened calf and kill it! Let’s celebrate with a feast! 
15:24 For this son of mine was dead and has come back to life—he was lost and is found!’ Then they began to celebrate. 
15:25 “Now his older son was out in the field. And as he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. 
15:26 And he called out to one of the servants and began to ask what these things could be. 
15:27 “The servant said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he got him back safe and sound.’ 
15:28 “But the older son was angry and didn’t want to go in. So his father came outside and pleaded with him. 
15:29 But he answered and said to his father, ‘Look, so many years I’ve slaved away for you—not once did I ignore your order. Yet you’ve never given me a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. 
15:30 But when this son of yours came—the one who has squandered your wealth with prostitutes—for him you killed the fattened calf!” 
15:31 “Then the father said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and everything that is mine is yours. 
15:32 But it was right to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead but has come back to life! He was lost, but is found.’” 
16:1  was also saying to the disciples, “There was a rich man who had a household manager, and this manager was accused of squandering his belongings. 
16:2 So he called the manager and said to him, ‘What’s this I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.’ 
16:3 “Then the manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I’m not strong enough to dig; I’m ashamed to beg. 
16:4 I know what I’ll do, so that when I’m put out of management others will welcome me into their homes.’ 
16:5 So he called in each one of his master’s debtors, and he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’ 
16:6 “He said, ‘One hundred units of olive oil.’ “The manager said to him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and write fifty.’ 
16:7 Then he said to another, ‘Now how much do you owe?’ “He said, ‘A hundred units of wheat.’ “The manager said to him, ‘Take your bill and write eighty.’ 
16:8 “Now the master praised the crooked manager because he had acted shrewdly, for the sons of this age are smarter when dealing with their own generation than the sons of light. 
16:9 I say to you, make friends for yourselves from the wealth of the world, so when it runs out, they will welcome you into the eternal shelters. 
16:10 “One who is faithful in the smallest matters is also faithful in much, and the one unjust in the smallest matters will likewise be unjust in much. 
16:11 So then, if you cannot be trusted with unjust wealth, who will trust you with true wealth? 
16:12 Now if you have not been trustworthy with what belongs to another, who will give you anything of your own? 
16:13 No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick by one and look down on the other. You cannot serve God and money.”
16:14 . 
16:15 But He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves before the people, but God knows your hearts. For what is prized among men is detestable in God’s sight.” 
16:16  and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since then, the Good News of the kingdom of God is being proclaimed, and everyone tries forcing his way in. 
16:17  to fail. 
16:18 Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. And he who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery. 
16:19 “Now there was a rich man dressed in purple and fine linen, living it up in luxury every day. 
16:20 But a poor man named Lazarus had been laid at his gate, covered with sores 
16:21 and longing to be fed with what fell from the rich man’s table. Besides, even the dogs were coming to lick his sores. 
16:22 “It happened that the poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s side. Then the rich man also died and was buried. 
16:23 , as he was in torment, he raised his eyes. And he sees Abraham far off, and Lazarus at his side. 
16:24 So he cried out and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me! And send Lazarus so he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue, because I am suffering torment in this flame.’ 
16:25 “But Abraham said, ‘Son, remember that in your life you received your good things, even as Lazarus received the bad things. But now he is comforted here, and you are tormented. 
16:26 Besides all this, between us and you a great chasm is firmly set, so that those who want to cross over to you cannot, nor can those from there cross over to us. 
16:27 “Then the rich man said, ‘I beg you then, Father Abraham, send Lazarus to my father’s house! 
16:28 For I have five brothers to warn, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.’ 
16:29 “But Abraham says, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets. Let them listen to them.’ 
16:30 “But he said, ‘No, Father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’ 
16:31 “But Abraham said, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead!’”
17:1  said to His disciples, “Stumbling blocks are bound to come, but woe to the one by whom they come! 
17:2 It would be better for him to have a millstone put around his neck and to be hurled into the sea, than for him to cause one of these little ones to stumble. 
17:3 “Keep yourselves alert! If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. 
17:4 Even if he sins against you seven times a day, and seven times returns to you, saying, ‘I repent,’ you shall forgive him.” 
17:5 Then the emissaries said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!” 
17:6 Then the Lord said, “If you have faith like a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you. 
17:7 But if you have a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, who among you will say to him when he comes in from the field, ‘Come right in, and recline at table’? 
17:8 But won’t he instead say to him, ‘Prepare something for me to eat! Dress yourself and wait on me while I eat and drink; and afterward, you may eat and drink’? 
17:9 He doesn’t thank the slave because he did what he was commanded, does he? 
17:10 So you too, when you’ve done everything you are commanded, say, ‘We are unworthy slaves. We have done only what we were supposed to do.’”
17:11  was passing between Samaria and the Galilee. 
17:12  came toward Him. They stood some distance away 
17:13 , Master, have mercy on us!” 
17:14 .” And as they went, they were cleansed. 
17:15 Now one of them, when he saw that he was healed, came back, glorifying God with a loud voice. 
17:16 ’s feet, facedown, giving Him thanks. And he was a Samaritan. 
17:17  answered and said, “Weren’t ten cleansed? But where are the nine? 
17:18 Weren’t any found who came back to give glory to God except this foreigner?” 
17:19  said to the man, “Stand up and go! Your faith has made you well.” 
17:20  was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said, “The kingdom of God does not come with signs to be seen. 
17:21 Nor will they say, ‘Look, here!’ or ‘There!’ For behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.” 
17:22  said to the disciples, “The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it. 
17:23 They will say to you, ‘Look, there!’ or ‘Look, here!’ Do not go and chase after them. 
17:24 For just as the lightning flashes from one part of the sky and lights up another part, so will the Son of Man be in His day. 
17:25 But first He must suffer much and be rejected by this generation. 
17:26 As it was in the days of Noah, so will it also be in the days of the Son of Man. 
17:27 They were eating, drinking, marrying, and being given in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all. 
17:28 “It was just the same in the days of Lot. They were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building. 
17:29 But on the day Lot left Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed them all. 
17:30 Things will be the same on the day when the Son of Man is made fully known. 
17:31 In that day, the one who is on the roof, and his possessions in the house, must not go down to take them away. In the same way, the one who is in the field must not turn back. 
17:32 Remember Lot’s wife! 
17:33 Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life will preserve it. 
17:34 “I tell you, on that night there will be two in one bed. One will be taken along and the other left. 
17:35 There will be two women grinding at the same place. One will be taken and the other left.”
17:36   
17:37 “Where, Lord?” they replied. And He said to them, “Where there is a corpse, there also will the vultures be gathered.”
18:1  told them a parable to show that they should always pray and not be discouraged, 
18:2 He said, “There was a judge in a certain city who neither feared God nor respected people. 
18:3 And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him, saying, ‘Give me justice against my opponent.’ 
18:4 “He was unwilling at the time. But afterward he said to himself, ‘Although I don’t fear God or respect people, 
18:5 yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice so she won’t wear me out by her incessant coming.’” 
18:6 Then the Lord said, “Hear what the unjust judge is saying. 
18:7 Won’t God do justice for His chosen ones, who cry out to Him day and night? Will He be slow to help them? 
18:8 I tell you, He will quickly give them justice. But when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?” 
18:9  spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, while holding others in contempt. 
18:10 “Two men went up to the Temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 
18:11 The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself: ‘O God, I thank You that I am not like other people—thieving, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. 
18:12 I fast twice a week and tithe on all that I get.’ 
18:13 “But the tax collector, standing some distance away, wouldn’t even lift his eyes toward heaven, but beat his chest, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, the sinner!’ 
18:14 I tell you, this man, rather than the other, went down to his home declared righteous. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” 
18:15 , so He might touch them. But when the disciples saw this, they began rebuking them. 
18:16  called for them, saying, “Let the little children come to Me and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. 
18:17 Amen, I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.” 
18:18 , saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” 
18:19  said to him. “No one is good except One—that is God. 
18:20 You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’” 
18:21 The man said, “All these I have kept since my youth.” 
18:22  heard this, He said to him, “One thing you still lack. Sell all, as much as you have, and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.” 
18:23 But upon hearing these things, he became deeply distressed, for he was very rich. 
18:24  said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter into the kingdom of God! 
18:25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” 
18:26 Then those who heard said, “Then who can be saved?” 
18:27  said, “What is impossible with men is possible with God.” 
18:28 Then Peter said, “Look, we’ve left everything of our own to follow You.” 
18:29  said to them, “Amen, I tell you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, 
18:30  , eternal life.” 
18:31  took the twelve aside and said to them, “Look, we’re going up to Jerusalem, and everything written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be carried out. 
18:32 He will be handed over to the Gentiles, and He will be mocked and insulted and spat upon. 
18:33 After they have scourged Him, they will kill Him. Yet on the third day, He will rise again.” 
18:34 But they understood none of these things; this message was hidden from them, and they did not understand what He was saying. 
18:35  was approaching Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting by the road, begging. 
18:36 But when he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening. 
18:37  ha-Natzrati was passing by. 
18:38 , have mercy on me!” 
18:39 , have mercy on me!” 
18:40  asked him, 
18:41 “What do you want Me to do for you?” And he said, “Master, I want to see again!” 
18:42  said to him, “Receive your sight. Your faith has made you well.” 
18:43 , glorifying God. And when all the people saw it, they also gave praise to God.
19:1  entered Jericho and was passing through. 
19:2 And here was a man by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. 
19:3  was, but he couldn’t because of the crowd, for he was short in height. 
19:4 , for He was about to pass through that way. 
19:5  came to the place, He looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today.” 
19:6 Zacchaeus hurried and came down and welcomed Him joyfully. 
19:7  has gone to be the guest of a sinner!” 
19:8 But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord. “Look, Master, half of my possessions I give to the poor, and if I have somehow cheated anyone, I repay four times as much!” 
19:9  said to him, “Today salvation has come to this home, because he also is a son of Abraham. 
19:10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.” 
19:11  went on to tell a parable, because He was near Jerusalem and they supposed that the kingdom of God was about to appear at once. 
19:12 Therefore He said, “A certain nobleman went to a faraway land to receive for himself a kingdom and then return. 
19:13 And calling ten of his own slaves, he gave them ten minas and said to them, ‘Do business until I come back.’ 
19:14 But his citizens detested him and they sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We don’t want this fellow to reign over us!’ 
19:15 When he returned after receiving the kingdom, he called for those slaves to whom he had given the money. He wanted to know how much business they had done. 
19:16 Now the first appeared, saying, ‘Master, your one mina has made ten.’ 
19:17 The master said to him, ‘Well done, good slave! Because you were faithful with so little, take charge over ten cities.’ 
19:18 Also, the second slave came, saying, ‘Your mina, Master, made five.’ 
19:19 Then he also said to this one, ‘You are likewise over five cities.’ 
19:20 But another came, saying, ‘Master, here is your mina. I was keeping it safe in a handkerchief, 
19:21 for I was afraid of you because you are a strict man. You take what you did not make and reap what you did not sow.’ 
19:22 He said to him, ‘By the words of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked slave! You knew that I am strict, taking what I did not make and reaping what I did not sow? 
19:23 Then why didn’t you put my money in the bank, so that when I came back I could have collected it with interest?’ 
19:24 Then to the bystanders he said, ‘Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has ten minas.’ 
19:25 But they said to him, ‘Sir, he has ten minas!’ 
19:26 ‘I tell you, to everyone who has, more shall be given. But from the one who doesn’t have, even what he does have shall be taken away. 
19:27 But those hostile to me, who didn’t want me to reign over them, bring them here and execute them before me.’”
19:28  was going on ahead, up to Jerusalem. 
19:29 When He got near Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, He sent two of the disciples, 
19:30 saying, “Go into the village ahead. As you enter, you will find a colt tied up, that no one has ever sat upon. Untie it and bring it. 
19:31 And if anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you shall say, ‘The Master needs it.’” 
19:32 Those who were headed out found things just as He told them. 
19:33 Then as they were untying the colt, his owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?” 
19:34 They said, “The Master needs it.” 
19:35  on it. 
19:36 And as He went along, the people were spreading their cloaks on the road. 
19:37  came near the slope of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began to rejoice. They praised God with a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen, 
19:38  in heaven and glory in the highest!” 
19:39 Some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, rebuke Your disciples!” 
19:40  said, “I tell you that if these keep silent, the stones will shout out!” 
19:41 As He drew near and saw Jerusalem, He wept over her, 
19:42 ! But now they are hidden from your eyes. 
19:43 For the days will come upon you when your enemies will surround you with barricades and hem you in on all sides. 
19:44 And they will smash you to the ground—you and your children within you. And they won’t leave within you one stone upon another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.”
19:45  entered the Temple and began to drive out the merchants, 
19:46 saying to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a ‘den of thieves.’” 
19:47  scholars, even the leaders of the people, were trying to destroy Him; 
19:48 but they could not find any way to do it, because all the people were hanging on His words.
20:1  scholars, together with the elders, confronted Him. 
20:2 And they spoke, saying to Him, “Tell us by what authority are You doing these things? Or who is the one who gave You this authority?” 
20:3  said to them, “I also will ask you a question, and you tell Me: 
20:4 the immersion of John—was it from heaven or from men?” 
20:5 They reasoned among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’ 
20:6 But if we say, ‘From men,’ then all the people will stone us, because they are convinced that John is a prophet.” 
20:7 So they answered that they didn’t know where it came from. 
20:8  said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.” 
20:9 Then He began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey for a long time. 
20:10 And at the season, he sent a servant to the tenants so that they would give him part of the vineyard’s fruit. But the tenants beat him up and sent him away empty-handed. 
20:11 So he proceeded to send another servant. They beat him too and treated him shamefully, and they sent him away empty-handed. 
20:12 And he proceeded to send a third one. They wounded this one too, and they threw him out. 
20:13 “Now the master of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love. Probably they will show him respect.’ 
20:14 But when the tenants saw him, they discussed the matter among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir! Let’s kill him so the inheritance will be ours.’ 
20:15 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the master of the vineyard do to them? 
20:16 He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.” But when they heard this, they said, “May it never happen!” 
20:17  looked right at them and said, “Then what is this that has been written, ‘The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the chief cornerstone’? 
20:18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be shattered; but the one upon whom it falls, it will crush him.” 
20:19  tried to grab Him that very hour, because they realized that He spoke this parable against them—but they feared the people.
20:20 Now they watched Him and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, in order to trap Him in His words so they could hand Him over to the power and authority of the governor. 
20:21 And they asked Him, saying, “Teacher, we know that You tell it straight and You teach it straight. You show no partiality, but teach the way of God according to the truth. 
20:22 Is it permitted for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” 
20:23  said to them, 
20:24 “Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?” And they said, “Caesar’s.” 
20:25 Then He said to them, “Well then, give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” 
20:26 And they could not trap Him in His words in the presence of the people. Astonished by His answer, they kept silent. 
20:27 . 
20:28 “Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that ‘if a man’s brother dies’ having a wife ‘but no children, then his brother should take the widow and father children for his brother.’ 
20:29 Now there were seven brothers, and the first took a wife and died childless; 
20:30 and the second 
20:31 and the third took her, but in this same way, each of the seven brothers died and left no children. 
20:32 Finally the woman died too. 
20:33 So in the resurrection, whose wife is she? For all seven had married her.” 
20:34  said to them, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage. 
20:35  and the resurrection of the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage. 
20:36 For they can no longer die, because they are like angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. 
20:37  ‘the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ 
20:38 Now He is God not of the dead but of the living, for to Him they all are living.” 
20:39  scholars replied, “Teacher, You have said it well.” 
20:40 For they no longer dared to question Him about anything. 
20:41 ? 
20:42  said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand, 
20:43 until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.”’ 
20:44 David then calls Him ‘Lord’; so how is He his son?” 
20:45  said to the disciples, 
20:46  scholars, who like to walk around in long robes. They love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at feasts. 
20:47 They devour widows’ houses and make long prayers as a show. These men will receive greater condemnation!”
21:1  looked up and saw the rich dropping their gifts into the treasury box. 
21:2 He also saw a poor widow dropping in two small copper coins. 
21:3 And He said, “Truly I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all the rest. 
21:4 For all these put in their gifts from their surplus. But she, out of her poverty, put in all she had to live on.” 
21:5  said, 
21:6 “As for these things you are looking at, the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another. Every one will be torn down!” 
21:7 And they questioned Him, saying, “Teacher, so when will these things happen? What will be the sign that these things are about to take place?” 
21:8 And He said, “Watch out that you are not led astray! For many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am He’ and ‘The time is near!’ Do not follow them. 
21:9 And when you hear of wars and chaos, do not be terrorized. For these things need to happen first, but the end will not come at once.” 
21:10 Then He continued telling them, “Nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. 
21:11 There will be great earthquakes along with famines and epidemics in various places, and there will be terrors along with great signs from heaven. 
21:12 But before all these things, they will grab you and persecute you, handing you over to the synagogues and prisons, and leading you away to kings and governors on account of My name. 
21:13 This will lead you to be a witness. 
21:14 So make up your minds not to prepare ahead of time to defend yourselves—
21:15 for I Myself will give you speech and wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute. 
21:16 But you will be handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends—and they will put some of you to death. 
21:17 And you will be hated by all because of My name. 
21:18 Yet not a hair of your head will be lost. 
21:19 By your endurance, you will gain your souls. 
21:20 “But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that her desolation is near. 
21:21 Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those inside the city must get out, and those in the countryside must not enter her. 
21:22 For these are the days of punishment, to fulfill all that has been written. 
21:23 “Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath on this people. 
21:24 They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led away captive into all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. 
21:25 “There will be signs in the sun and moon and stars. And upon the earth nations will be confused by the roaring of the sea and its waves. 
21:26 People will lose heart from fear and anticipation of what is overtaking the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 
21:27 And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 
21:28 Now when these things begin to happen, stand straight and lift up your heads, because your salvation is near!” 
21:29  told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees. 
21:30 As soon as they sprout their leaves, you see it and you know at once that summer is near. 
21:31 So also, when you see these all these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. 
21:32 Amen, I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things happen. 
21:33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away. 
21:34 “But watch out so your hearts are not weighed down by carousing, strong drink, and the worries of life. Do not let that day come upon you suddenly like a trap. 
21:35 For it will come rushing upon all who live on the face of the whole earth. 
21:36 But stay alert at all times, praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things about to happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.” 
21:37  was teaching in the Temple, but in the nights He went out and stayed on the Mount of Olives. 
21:38 And all the people would come early in the morning to hear Him in the Temple. 
22:1 , which is called Passover, was approaching. 
22:2 , for they were afraid of the people. 
22:3 Then satan entered into Judah, the one from Kriot, one of the twelve. 
22:4  over to them. 
22:5 They were delighted and agreed to give him money. 
22:6  over to them without a crowd. 
22:7  when the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. 
22:8  sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us, so we may eat.” 
22:9 Then they said to Him, “Where do You want us to prepare?” 
22:10 And He said to them, “Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters. 
22:11 And say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?”’ 
22:12 And with that, he will show you a large upper room, fully furnished. Make preparations there.” 
22:13  had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
22:14  reclined at table, and the emissaries with Him. 
22:15 And He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. 
22:16 For I tell you, I will never eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” 
22:17 , He said, “Take this and share it among yourselves. 
22:18 For I tell you that I will never drink of the fruit of the vine from now on, until the kingdom of God comes.” 
22:19 , He broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is My body, given for you. Do this in memory of Me.” 
22:20 In the same way, He took the cup after the meal, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you. 
22:21 But look, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Mine on the table. 
22:22 For indeed, the Son of Man is going as has been predetermined; but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!” 
22:23 So they began to discuss among themselves which of them it might be who would do this thing. 
22:24 But there was also a quarrel among them about which of them is considered the greatest. 
22:25  said to them, “The kings of the nations have mastery over them, and those exercising authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’ 
22:26 But with you, it is not so. Rather, let the one who is greatest among you become like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves. 
22:27 For who is greater, the one who reclines or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as one who serves. 
22:28 “You are the ones who have remained with Me in My times of testing. 
22:29 And just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom, so I grant to you 
22:30 that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and you shall sit upon thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
22:31 “Simon, Simon! Indeed, satan has demanded to sift you all like wheat. 
22:32 But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith will not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.” 
22:33 But Simon said to Him, “Master, I am ready to go with You even to prison and to death!” 
22:34  said, “I tell you, Peter, a rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.” 
22:35 And He said to them, “When I sent you out without a money pouch and travel bag and sandals, you didn’t lack anything, did you?” They said, “No, nothing.” 
22:36 Then He said to them, “But now, whoever has a money pouch must carry it as well as a travel bag. And whoever does not own a sword must sell his cloak and buy one. 
22:37 For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me: ‘And he was counted with the lawless.’ For what is written about Me is being fulfilled.” 
22:38 But they said, “Master, look here! Two swords!” And He said to them, “It is enough.” 
22:39  came out and went as usual to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed Him. 
22:40 When he reached the place, He said to them, “Pray that you will not enter into temptation.” 
22:41 And He pulled back about a stone’s throw from them, got on His knees, and began to pray, 
22:42 saying, “Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done.” 
22:43 Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him. 
22:44 And in His anguish, He was praying fervently; and His sweat was like drops of blood falling down on the ground. 
22:45 When He rose up from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them asleep, exhausted from grief. 
22:46 And He said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray, so that you won’t enter into temptation.”
22:47  to kiss Him. 
22:48  said to him, “Judah, with a kiss you betray the Son of Man?” 
22:49 When those around Him saw what was going to happen, they said to Him, “Master, shall we strike with the sword?” 
22:50  and cut off his right ear. 
22:51  answered and said, “Stop this now!” And He touched the man’s ear and healed him. 
22:52 , officers of the Temple guard, and the elders who had come against Him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against a revolutionary? 
22:53 Every day I was with you in the Temple, yet you did not lay a finger on Me. But this is yours—the hour and the power of darkness.” 
22:54  . But Peter was following from a distance.
22:55 Now they had lit a fire in the center of the courtyard and sat down together, and Peter was sitting among them. 
22:56 Then a servant girl saw him sitting at the fire. She looked straight at him and said, “This one was with Him too!” 
22:57 But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I don’t know Him!” 
22:58 A little later, another saw him and said, “You too are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not!” 
22:59 And about an hour later, another began to insist, saying, “Certainly this fellow was with Him, for he too is a Galilean!” 
22:60 But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. 
22:61 And the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had told him, ‘Before the rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.’ 
22:62 And Peter went out and wept bitterly. 
22:63  began mocking and beating Him. 
22:64 They blindfolded Him and kept asking Him, saying, “Prophesy! Who is the one who hit You?” 
22:65 And reviling Him, they were saying many other things against Him.
22:66  scholars, and they led Him away to their council, saying, 
22:67  said to them, “If I tell you, you will never believe; 
22:68 and if I ask you, you will never answer. 
22:69 But from now on, the Son of Man is seated at the right hand of the power of God.” 
22:70 ?” And to them He said, “You say that I am.” 
22:71 Then they said, “What further need do we have for testimony? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth!”
23:1  to Pilate. 
23:2 And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this fellow subverting our nation, forbidding payment of taxes to Caesar and saying that He Himself is Messiah—a king.” 
23:3  replied. 
23:4  and the crowds, “I find no case against this Man.” 
23:5 But they kept insisting, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, starting from the Galilee to as far as here.” 
23:6 But when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the Man was a Galilean. 
23:7  was from Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. 
23:8 , for he had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had heard about Him and was hoping to see some miracle done by Him. 
23:9  did not answer at all. 
23:10  scholars stood their ground, strongly accusing Him. 
23:11 Now Herod together with his soldiers were treating Him with contempt and mocking Him. They put splendid clothing on Him and sent Him back to Pilate. 
23:12 And Herod and Pilate became friends with one another from that very day, for previously they had been enemies with one another.
23:13 , the leaders, and the people. 
23:14 And he said to them, “You brought this Man to me as one who incites the people to revolt. But having examined Him in your presence, I have found no case against this Man regarding what you accuse Him of doing. 
23:15 Nor did Herod, for he sent Him back to us. Indeed, He has done nothing that is worthy of death. 
23:16 Therefore I will scourge Him and release Him.”
23:17 ]
23:18 !” 
23:19 (He was someone who had been thrown into prison for a rebellion in the city and murder.) 
23:20 ; 
23:21 but they kept shouting out, saying, “Execute, execute Him!” 
23:22 And a third time he spoke to them, “Why? What evil has this One done? I have found in Him no fault deserving of death. Therefore, I will scourge and release Him.” 
23:23 But they were insistent, demanding with loud shouts that He be executed. And their voices prevailed. 
23:24 So Pilate decreed that their demand be put into effect. 
23:25  to their will.
23:26 . 
23:27 Now a great multitude of people was following Him, including women who were mourning and singing dirges for Him. 
23:28 , turning to them, said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but for yourselves and your children. 
23:29 For indeed, the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are barren, and the wombs that never gave birth, and the breasts that did not feed.’ 
23:30 ’Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us!’ 
23:31 ”For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?” 
23:32 Others, two evildoers, were also led away to be put to death with Him. 
23:33 When they came to the place called the Skull, there they crucified Him and the evildoers, one on His right and the other on His left. 
23:34  was saying, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” Then they cast lots, dividing up His clothing. 
23:35 The people stood there watching. And even the leaders were sneering at Him, saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Messiah of God, the Chosen One!” 
23:36 The soldiers likewise mocked Him, coming up and bringing Him sour wine, 
23:37 and saying, “If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself.” 
23:38 Now there was also an inscription over Him: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
23:39 One of the evildoers hanging there was jeering at Him, saying, “Aren’t You the Messiah? Save Yourself—and us!” 
23:40 But the other one, rebuking him, replied, “Don’t you fear God, since you are under the same sentence? 
23:41 We’re getting what we deserve for our actions, and rightly so—but this One has done nothing wrong.” 
23:42 , remember me when You come into Your kingdom.” 
23:43  said to him, “Amen, I tell you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise.”
23:44 It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour, 
23:45 for the sun died out. And the curtain of the Temple was torn in two. 
23:46 , crying out with a loud voice, said, “Father, ‘into Your hands I entrust My spirit.’” When He had said this, He breathed His last. 
23:47 Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he began glorifying God, saying, “Truly this was a righteous Man.” 
23:48 And all the crowds assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had happened, began to turn back, beating their breasts. 
23:49 ’s acquaintances, and the women who were following Him from the Galilee, were standing at a distance, watching these things.
23:50 Now there was a man named Joseph, a council member, a good and righteous man. 
23:51 (He had not been in agreement with the council and their action.) He was from the Judean town of Arimathea, and he was waiting for the kingdom of God. 
23:52 ’s body. 
23:53 And he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb cut out of the rock, where no one had ever yet been laid. 
23:54  was approaching. 
23:55 The women who had come with Him from the Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how His body was laid. 
23:56  they rested according to the commandment.
24:1 Now on the first day of the week, at daybreak, the women came to the tomb, carrying the spices they had prepared. 
24:2 They found the stone had been rolled away from the tomb; 
24:3 . 
24:4 And while they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them. 
24:5 The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you search for the living among the dead? 
24:6 He is not here, but He is risen! Remember what He told you when He was still in the Galilee, 
24:7 saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be executed, and on the third day rise up.” 
24:8 And they were reminded of His words. 
24:9 And when they returned from the tomb, they told all these things to the eleven and to everyone else. 
24:10 Now it was Miriam from Magdala, Joanna, the Miriam of Jacob and others together with them who were telling these things to the emissaries. 
24:11 But these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they would not believe them. 
24:12 But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Leaning in, he sees only the linen cloths. And he went away to his home, marveling at what had happened. 
24:13 Now behold, two of them on that very day were traveling to a village named Emmaus, a distance of about seven miles from Jerusalem. 
24:14 They were speaking with one another about all the things that had been happening. 
24:15  Himself approached and began traveling with them. 
24:16 But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him. 
24:17 Then He said to them, “What are these things you are discussing with one another as you are walking along?” They stood still, looking gloomy. 
24:18 Then the one named Cleopas answered and said to Him, “Are You the only one visiting Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things that happened there in these days?” 
24:19  from Natzeret, who was a Prophet, powerful in deed and word before God and all the people—
24:20  and our leaders handed Him over to be sentenced to death, and they executed Him. 
24:21 But we were hoping that He was the One about to redeem Israel. Besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened. 
24:22 “But also some women among us amazed us. Early in the morning they were at the tomb. 
24:23 When they didn’t find His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said He is alive! 
24:24 Some of those with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women said, but they did not see Him.” 
24:25  said to them, “Oh foolish ones, so slow of heart to put your trust in all that the prophets spoke! 
24:26 Was it not necessary for Messiah to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?” 
24:27 Then beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them the things written about Himself in all the Scriptures. 
24:28 They approached the village where they were going, and He acted as though He were going farther on. 
24:29 But they urged Him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is already gone.” So He went in to stay with them. 
24:30  and, breaking it, gave it to them. 
24:31 Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him, and He disappeared from them.
24:32 They said to one another, “Didn’t our heart burn within us while He was speaking with us on the road, while He was explaining the Scriptures to us?” 
24:33 And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. They found the eleven and others with them gathered together, 
24:34 saying, “The Lord is risen indeed! He has appeared to Simon!” 
24:35  . 
24:36  Aleichem!” 
24:37 But they were startled and terrified, thinking they were seeing a ghost. 
24:38 Then He said to them, “Why are you so shaken? And why do doubts arise in your heart? 
24:39 Look at My hands and My feet—it is I Myself! Touch Me and see! For a spirit doesn’t have flesh and bones, as you see I have.” 
24:40 And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet. 
24:41 But while they were still in disbelief due to joy and wonder, He said to them, “Do you have anything to eat here?” 
24:42 They gave Him a piece of broiled fish, 
24:43 and He took it and ate it in their presence. 
24:44  of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled. 
24:45 Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, 
24:46 and He said to them, “So it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, 
24:47 and that repentance for the removal of sins is to be proclaimed in His name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. 
24:48 You are witnesses of these things. 
24:49 And behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.” 
24:50  led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them. 
24:51 And while blessing them, He departed from them and was taken up into heaven. 
24:52 After worshiping Him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy. 
24:53 And they were continually in the Temple, praising God.
