1:1  spoke to Moses in the Tent of Meeting saying, 
1:2  by their families and their ancestral house, with a total of every male one by one. 
1:3 You and Aaron are to muster by their divisions every son from 20 years and upward available to serve in the army of Israel. 
1:4 One man from each tribe, each head of his father’s household, is to assist you. 
1:5 “These then are the names of the men who will assist you: from Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur. 
1:6 From Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai. 
1:7 From Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab. 
1:8 From Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar. 
1:9 From Zebulon, Eliab son of Helon. 
1:10 From the sons of Joseph—from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud, from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur. 
1:11 From Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni. 
1:12 From Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai. 
1:13 From Asher, Pagiel son of Ochran. 
1:14 From Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel. 
1:15 From Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan.” 
1:16 These were those selected from the community, princes of their ancestral tribes. They were heads of the thousands of Israel. 
1:17 So Moses and Aaron took these men designated by name. 
1:18 They assembled all the community on the first day of the second month. They declared their lineage according to their families, the households of their forefathers, with the number of the names of those 20 years old and upward being listed individually. 
1:19  had commanded him. 
1:20 The sons of Reuben, Israel’s firstborn (their generations, their families, by their ancestral households, according to the count of their names, every male from 20 years and upward, all available for the army), 
1:21 those counted from the tribe of Reuben were 46,500. 
1:22 From the sons of Simeon (their generations, according to their families, their ancestral households, whose names were counted by polls, every male 20 years and upward, every one who would go with the army), 
1:23 they counted from the tribe of Simeon 59,300. 
1:24 From the sons of Gad (their generations according to their families, to their ancestral households, in the count of names of every male 20 years old and upward, every one available to go out with the army), 
1:25 those counted from the tribe of Gad were 45,650. 
1:26 From the sons of Judah (their generations, by their families, their ancestral households, the count of their names, all who would go out with the army), 
1:27 those counted from the tribe of Judah were 74,600. 
1:28 From the sons of Issachar (their generations, according to their families, their ancestral households, by number of the names of every male 20 years old and upward, going out with the army), 
1:29 those counted from the tribe of Issachar were 54,400. 
1:30 From the sons of Zebulon (their generations, according to their families, to their ancestral households, by number of the names of everyone 20 years old and upward going out with the army), 
1:31 those counted from the tribe of Zebulun were 57,400. 
1:32 From the sons of Joseph—the sons of Ephraim (their generations according to their families, to their ancestral households, by count of the names of all those 20 years old and upward going out with the army), 
1:33 those numbered from the tribe of Ephraim were 40,500. 
1:34 From the sons of Manasseh (their generations according to their families, their ancestral households, by number of the names of those 20 years old and upward going out with the army), 
1:35 those counted from the tribe of Manasseh were 32,200. 
1:36 From the sons of Benjamin (their generations by their families, their ancestral households, by number of the names of every one 20 years old and upward going out with the army), 
1:37 those numbered from the tribe of Benjamin were 35,400.

1:41 those counted from the tribe of Asher were 41,500. 
1:42 From the sons of Naphtali (their generations by their families, their ancestral households, by number everyone 20 years old and upward who would go out with the army), 
1:43 those counted from the tribe of Naphtali were 53,400. 
1:44 These were the ones numbered—Moses, Aaron and the princes of Israel counted them. Each of the twelve men represented his ancestral house. 
1:45 , according to their ancestral houses, from 20 years old and up—all able to go out with the army in Israel— 
1:46 all those who were counted totaled 603,550. 
1:47 The Levites, however, were not counted by the tribe of their ancestors, 
1:48  told Moses saying, 
1:49 . 
1:50 Instead, you are to appoint the Levites over the Tabernacle of the Testimony, over all its implements and all pertaining to it. They are to carry the Tabernacle and all its utensils, tend to it and camp around it. 
1:51 Whenever the Tabernacle sets out, the Levites are to dismantle it, and whenever the Tabernacle is pitched, the Levites are to set it up. But the commoner who comes near to it must be put to death. 
1:52  will encamp, each man with his own camp, each with his own standard, according to their own divisions. 
1:53 . So the Levites are to maintain care of the Tabernacle of the Testimony. 
1:54  commanded Moses, so they did.
2:1  said to Moses and Aaron saying, “
2:2 Let each man encamp under his own standard among the banners of their ancestral house at an appropriate distance around the Tent of Meeting. 
2:3 Those camping on the east—toward the sunrise—will be of the standard of Judah, according to their divisions. Nachshon son of Amminadab, is the prince of the sons of Judah. 
2:4 His division, by their number, is 74,600. 
2:5 Camping next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar. The prince of the sons of Issachar is Nethanel son of Zuar. 
2:6 Their division, by their number, is 54,400. 
2:7 Next, the tribe of Zebulun. The prince of the sons of Zebulun is Eliab son of Helon. 
2:8 His division, by count, is 57,400. 
2:9 All those numbered to Judah’s camp, by their divisions, are 186,400. They are to advance first. 
2:10 The standard of the camp of Reuben shall be on the south side, by their divisions. The prince of the sons of Reuben is Elizur son of Shedeur. 
2:11 His division, by their number, is 46,500. 
2:12 Those camping next to them are the tribe of Simeon. The prince of the sons of Simeon is Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai. 
2:13 His division, by their number, is 59,300.

2:15 His division, by their numbers, is 45,650. 
2:16 All those numbered to the camp of Reuben are 151,450. They are to set out second. 
2:17 Then the Tent of Meeting will move out with the camp of the Levites, which is in the middle of the camps—just as they were in camp, each person in his own place under his own appropriate standard. 
2:18 On the west will be the standard of the camp of Ephraim, by their divisions. The prince of the sons of Ephraim is Elishama son of Ammihud. 
2:19 His division, by their numbers, is 40,500. 
2:20 Next to him is the tribe of Manasseh. The prince of the sons of Manasseh is Gamaliel, son of Pedahzur. 
2:21 His division, by their numbers, is 32,200. 
2:22 Next, the tribe of Benjamin. The prince of the sons of Benjamin is Abidan son of Gideoni. 
2:23 His division, by their numbers, is 35,400. 
2:24 All those numbered to the camp of Ephraim are 108,100, by their divisions. They are to advance third. 
2:25 The standard of the camp of Dan shall be on the north, according to their divisions. The prince of the sons of Dan is Ahiezer, son of Ammishaddai. 
2:26 His division, by their numbers, is 62,700. 
2:27 Next to him will encamp the tribe of Asher. The prince of the sons of Asher is Pagiel, son of Ochran. 
2:28 His division, by their numbers, is 41,500. 
2:29 Next, tribe of Naphtali. The prince of the sons of Naphtali is Ahira son of Enan. 
2:30 His division, by their numbers, is 53,400. 
2:31 All those numbered to the camp of Dan are 157,600. They are to advance last by their standards. 
2:32 , in accordance with their ancestral households. All those counted according to their divisions are 603,550. 
2:33  commanded Moses. 
2:34  had commanded Moses. Thus they camped by their standards and set out, each man according to their families and their ancestral houses.
3:1  spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai. 
3:2 These are the names of Aaron’s sons: Nadab the first-born, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
3:3  whom he consecrated to be priests. 
3:4  under Aaron their father. 
3:5  spoke to Moses saying, 
3:6 . 
3:7 They are to keep watch over duties for him and the entire community before the Tent of Meeting while performing the service of the Tabernacle. 
3:8  while performing the service of the Tabernacle. 
3:9  they are dedicated entirely to him. 
3:10 You are to appoint Aaron and his sons to maintain the priesthood; any commoner who approaches must be executed.” 
3:11  said to Moses saying, 
3:12 . The Levites will be Mine, 
3:13 .” 
3:14  spoke in the Sinai wilderness to Moses saying, 
3:15 “Count the sons of Levi. According to their ancestral house, by their families, every male a month old and upward you are to number them.” 
3:16 , just as he was commanded. 
3:17 These were the sons of Levi, by their names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
3:18 These then were the names of the sons of Gershon by their families—Libni and Shimei. 
3:19 The sons of Kohath by their families were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 
3:20 The sons of Merari, by their families, are Mahli and Mushi. These then were the families of the Levites by their ancestral households. 
3:21 To Gershon belonged the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimeites. These were the families of the Gershonites. 
3:22 The number of every male one month old and upward who were counted was 7,500. 
3:23 The Gershonites were to camp behind the Tabernacle on the west. 
3:24 The prince of the ancestral house of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael. 
3:25 The duties of the sons of Gershon in the Tent of Meeting were the Tabernacle, the tent, its coverings, the curtain of the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, 
3:26 the curtains of the courtyard, the screen of the entrance of the courtyard around the Tabernacle and altar, its ropes and all related to its use. 
3:27 To Kohath belonged the family of the Amramites, the family of the Izharites, the Hebronites and the Uzzielites. These were the Kohathite families. 
3:28 The number of every male one month old and upward was 8,600. Their duties were caring for the Sanctuary. 
3:29 The Kohathite families were to camp along the side of the Tabernacle on the south. 
3:30 The prince of the ancestral household of the Kohathites was Elizaphan son of Uzziel. 
3:31 , the altars, and the implements of the Sanctuary used in service with them, the curtain and all involved with its use. 
3:32  appointed over those whose responsibility was the care of the Sanctuary. 
3:33 To Merari belonged the families of the Mahlites and the Mushites. These were the families of Merari. 
3:34 Their number by count of every male one month old and upward was 6,200. 
3:35 The prince of the household of the father of the Merarites was Zuriel son of Abihail. They were to camp on the north side of the Tabernacle. 
3:36 The sons of Merari were appointed over the care of the frames of the Tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, bases, and all equipment for its use, 
3:37 the posts of the surrounding courtyard, their bases, pegs and ropes. 
3:38 . But anyone unauthorized who approached had to be executed. 
3:39 , by their families, inclusive of every male one month old and upward, were 22,000.
3:40  from one month old and upward and make a list of their names. 
3:41 .” 
3:42  commanded him. 
3:43 , one month old and upward, listed by name, was 22,273. 
3:44  spoke to Moses saying, 
3:45 . 
3:46  exceeding the number of the Levites, 
3:47 you are to collect five shekels for each, based on the shekel of the Sanctuary, which is 20 gerahs. 
3:48 Give the money for the redemption of the extra ones of the firstborn of them to Aaron and his sons.” 
3:49 Hence Moses collected the redemption money for those exceeding the number redeemed by the Levites. 
3:50  he collected silver weighing 1,365 shekels, according to the Sanctuary shekel. 
3:51 .
4:1  spoke to Moses and to Aaron saying, 
4:2 “Take a census of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families and by their ancestral households, 
4:3 everyone from 30 years of age to 50, all who come to serve doing the work in the Tent of Meeting. 
4:4 “This is the task of the sons of Kohath in the Tent of Meeting—the most holy things. 
4:5 Whenever the camp is about to move out, Aaron and his sons are to take down the shielding curtain and cover the Ark of the Testimony with it. 
4:6 Then they are to cover this with porpoise hide, then spread over it a cloth of solid blue. Then they are to put its poles in place. 
4:7 “Then over the table of the Presence they are to spread a solid blue cloth, then lay on it the plates, ladles, bowls, and jars for the drink offering. The bread that is continually there is to remain there. 
4:8 Over them they are to spread a solid scarlet cloth, cover it with a covering of porpoise hide, then install its poles. 
4:9  for light, along with its lamps, tongs, snuffers and oil jars that they use to tend to it. 
4:10 They then are to wrap it and all its accessories in a cover of porpoise hide and place it all on a carrying frame. 
4:11 “Over the golden altar they are to spread a blue cloth and cover that with a covering of porpoise hide, then put its poles in place. 
4:12 “They are to take all the utensils used for the service of the ministry of the Sanctuary, wrap them in a blue cloth, cover them with porpoise hide, and place them on a carrying frame. 
4:13 “They are to remove the ashes from the altar, then spread over it a purple cloth. 
4:14 They are to put onto it all the utensils with which they tend to the altar, among them the firepans, meat forks, shovels and sprinkling bowls. They are to spread over it a covering of porpoise hide and install its poles. 
4:15 “When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the Sanctuary and all its holy implements, and when the camp is ready to move out, after this the sons of Kohath may come to do the carrying. But they must not touch the holy items or they will die. These are the task of the sons of Kohath with regard to the Tent of Meeting. 
4:16  will have charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering and the anointing oil. He is to have charge of the Tabernacle and all that is in it, including its holy items and all its implements.” 
4:17  spoke to Moses and Aaron saying, 
4:18 “You are not to let the families of the tribe of the Kohathites be cut off from among the Levites. 
4:19 Do this for them so that they may live and not die whenever they approach the most holy items–-Aaron and his sons are to go into the Sanctuary and assign each man his job and his responsibility. 
4:20 But the Kohathites are not to go in to look at what is holy, not even momentarily, or they will die.” 
4:21  spoke to Moses saying, 
4:22 “Take a census also of the sons of Gershon, by their ancestral households and by their families. 
4:23 Count all the males from 30 to 50 years of age, everyone coming to work in the service of the Tent of Meeting. 
4:24 This is the task of the Gershonite families in working and carrying burdens. 
4:25 They are to carry the curtains of the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, its covering, the outer covering of porpoise hide, the curtains for the entrance for the Tent of Meeting, 
4:26 the curtains surrounding the courtyard and the altar, the curtain for the entrance, the ropes and all the equipment used in its operations. They are to do all that needs to be done with these things. 
4:27 The sons of the Gershonites are to do all their tasks, whether carrying or doing other work, according to the word of Aaron and his sons. You are to assign to them all that is their responsibility to carry. 
4:28 . 
4:29 Next, count the sons of Merari, according to their families and their ancestral houses, 
4:30 sons 30 years old and upward to 50, everyone coming to work in the service of the Tent of Meeting. 
4:31 This is their task in the service of the Tent of Meeting: the frames of the Tabernacle, its crossbars, posts and bases, 
4:32 as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard, plus their bases, tent pegs, ropes, and all their paraphernalia with everything related to their operation. Assign to them by name their duties and tasks. 
4:33 .” 
4:34 So Moses, Aaron and the princes of the community counted the sons of the Kohathites according to their families and their ancestral households. 
4:35 All the men who came to do the service of the Tent of Meeting, from 30 to 50 years of age, 
4:36 were counted by families—2,750. 
4:37  by Moses’s hand. 
4:38 The sons of Gershon were counted according to their families and their ancestral households. 
4:39 Males from 30 years old and upward to 50, all those coming into the work of the service of the Tent of Meeting, 
4:40 numbered according to their families and ancestral households 2,630. 
4:41 . 
4:42 Those were counted from the families and ancestral households of the sons of Merari, 
4:43 from 30 years of age upward to 50, who came to the work of the service of the Tent of Meeting. 
4:44 Numbered by their families, they were 3,200. 
4:45  by Moses’s hand. 
4:46 Thus Moses, Aaron and the princes of Israel counted all the Levites by their families and by their ancestral houses. 
4:47 All the men from 30 to 50 years old who came to do the work of the service and of carrying the Tent of Meeting 
4:48 numbered 8,580. 
4:49  commanded Moses.
5:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
5:2 , who has some kind of discharge, or any contaminated by a dead body. 
5:3 Whether male or female, you are to send them outside the camp so as not to defile the camp where I am dwelling among them.” 
5:4  did. 
5:5  spoke to Moses saying, 
5:6 , that soul bears guilt. 
5:7 That person is to confess the sin he has committed, make full restitution for his wrong, add one fifth to it and give it to the one he wronged. 
5:8  along with the ram of atonement with which he is to make atonement for him. 
5:9  will belong to him. 
5:10 .”
5:11  spoke to Moses saying, 
5:12  and say to them: Suppose some man’s wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him, 
5:13 and another man has sexual relations with her, but it is hidden from her husband’s eyes and her impurity is not detected. Yet there was no witness against her and she was not caught in the act. 
5:14 Then a spirit of jealousy overcomes him and he is suspicious of his wife, when she is impure. Or a spirit of jealousy overcomes him and he suspects his wife, yet she is not impure. 
5:15 . He must also bring a tenth of an ephah of barley flour as an offering for her. He is not to pour oil or put incense on it, because it is an offering for jealousy, a reminder offering drawing attention to guiltiness. 
5:16 . 
5:17  is to take some holy water in a clay jar and take some dust from the floor of the Tabernacle and put it into the water. 
5:18 ’s own hands are the bitter waters that bring a curse. 
5:19  will have her swear under oath, then say to the woman, ‘If no man other than your husband has slept with you, and if you have not gone astray into impurity from your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you. 
5:20 If, however, you have gone astray from your husband and if you became impure and had sexual relations with a man other than your husband’—
5:21  causes your thigh to rot and your belly to swell. 
5:22 “May this water which brings a curse enter your body and cause your belly to swell and your thigh to rot.’ “The woman is to say, ‘Amen, amen!’ 
5:23  is to write these curses on a scroll and wash them into the waters of bitterness. 
5:24  will then have the woman drink the bitter water bearing curses, so that the water of the curses of bitterness enters her. 
5:25  and bring it to the altar. 
5:26  will then have the woman drink the water. 
5:27 “When she is made to drink the water that carries the curse, if she has defiled herself and been unfaithful to her husband, it will enter her and cause bitterness—her abdomen will swell and her thigh will waste away. She will be accursed among her people. 
5:28 If, however, the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, she will be free from guilt and be able to have children. 
5:29  regarding jealousy, when a woman goes astray from her husband and defiles herself, 
5:30  to her. 
5:31 The husband will be free of guilt, but that woman will bear her guilt.”
6:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
6:2 , 
6:3 is to abstain from wine and any other fermented drink. He is not to drink any vinegar made from wine or any fermented drink, or any grape juice, or eat grapes or raisins. 
6:4 “All during his days as a Nazirite he is not to eat anything from the grapevine—even the seeds or skins. 
6:5  is over. He is to be holy, and the hair of his head is to grow long. 
6:6 , he is not to go near a dead body. 
6:7 Even if his father, mother, brother or sister should die, he is not to make himself unclean, because his consecration to God is on his head. 
6:8 . 
6:9 “Now if someone should die suddenly in his presence, thereby defiling his dedicated head, he is to shave his head on the day of his purification—the seventh day. 
6:10  at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. 
6:11  is to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. He is to make atonement for him because he sinned through the corpse. He must consecrate his head on the same day. 
6:12  for the days of his Nazirite separation. He is to bring a year-old male lamb as a guilt offering. The previous days will not count because he was contaminated during his Nazirite separation. 
6:13  of the Nazirite when his period of separation is over. He must be brought to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. 
6:14 : a year-old male lamb without flaw as a burnt offering, a year-old female lamb without flaw as a sin offering, a flawless ram as a fellowship offering, 
6:15  wafers spread with oil, along with their grain and drink offerings. 
6:16 , and present his sin offering and burnt offering. 
6:17  will also present the grain and drink offerings. 
6:18 The Nazirite is then to shave the hair of his dedication at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and he is to take the hair of his dedication and put it into the fire of the fellowship offering sacrifice. 
6:19  wafer from the basket, and he is to place them into the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved the hair of his dedication. 
6:20  along with the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. Afterward, the Nazirite may drink wine. 
6:21  of his consecration.’”
6:22  spoke to Moses saying, 
6:23 , by saying to them: 
6:24  bless you and keep you! 
6:25  make His face to shine on you and be gracious to you! 
6:26 !’ 
6:27 , and so I will bless them.”
7:1 When Moses finished setting up the Tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it and all its implements, the altar and all its utensils, and he anointed and consecrated them. 
7:2 Then the princes of Israel, heads of their ancestral houses—they were tribal princes in charge over those who were numbered—gave offerings. 
7:3  six covered carts and twelve oxen. A cart came from every two princes and an ox from each one of them. They presented them before the Tabernacle. 
7:4  spoke to Moses saying, 
7:5 “Accept these from them to use in the service of the Tent of Meeting. Give them to the Levites to use as each man’s work requires.” 
7:6 So Moses took the carts and the oxen and he gave them to the Levites. 
7:7 He gave two carts and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, as their work required, 
7:8 . 
7:9 But to the sons of Kohath he did not give any because their responsibility was carrying the holy items on their shoulders. 
7:10 When the altar was anointed, the princes brought their dedication offerings and presented them before the altar. 
7:11  had said to Moses, “Each day one of the princes is to bring his offering for the altar’s dedication.” 
7:12 Bringing his offering on the first day was Nahshon son of Amminadab, from the tribe of Judah. 
7:13 His offering was one silver plate weighing 130 shekels, one silver basin weighing 70 shekels by the shekel of the Sanctuary, both of them filled with fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, 
7:14 one ladle of 10 shekels of gold filled with incense, 
7:15 one young bull from the herd, one ram, one male lamb a year old as a burnt offering, 
7:16 one male goat as a sin offering, 
7:17 and two oxen, five rams, five male goats and five male lambs one year old to be sacrificed as a fellowship offering. This was the offering of Nahshon son of Amminadab. 
7:18 On the second day, Nethanel son of Zuar, prince of Issachar, brought his offering. 
7:19 The offering he brought was one silver plate weighing 130 shekels, one silver basin weighing 70 shekels according to the shekel of the Sanctuary, both filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, 
7:20 one gold ladle of 10 shekels filled with incense, 
7:21 one young bull, one ram and one male lamb one year old for a burnt offering, 
7:22 one male goat for a sin offering, 
7:23 and two oxen, five rams, five male goats and five male lambs one year old to be sacrificed as a fellowship offering. This was the offering of Nethanel son of Zuar. 
7:24 On the third day was the prince of the sons of Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon. 
7:25 His offering was one silver plate weighing 130 shekels, one silver basin weighing 70 shekels, both according to the shekel of the Sanctuary, both filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, 
7:26 one ladle of 10 shekels of gold filled with incense, 
7:27 one young bull, one ram and one male lamb a year old for a burnt offering, 
7:28 one male goat for a sin offering, 
7:29 two oxen, five rams, five male goats and five male lambs a year old to be sacrificed as a fellowship offering. This was the offering of Eliab son of Helon. 
7:30 On the fourth day was the prince of the sons of Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur. 
7:31 His offering was one silver plate weighing 130 shekels, one silver basin weighing 70 shekels according to the shekel of the Sanctuary, both filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, 
7:32 one ladle of 10 shekels of gold filled with incense,

7:89 . So he spoke with Him.
8:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
8:2 .” 
8:3  had commanded Moses. 
8:4 . 
8:5  spoke to Moses saying, 
8:6  and ceremonially cleanse them. 
8:7 This is what you must do to them to make them clean: Sprinkle the purifying water on them, then have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes, thus purifying themselves. 
8:8 “Then they are to take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, plus a second young bull for a sin offering. 
8:9 . 
8:10  will lay their hands on the Levites, 
8:11 . 
8:12  to make atonement for the Levites. 
8:13 . 
8:14  to be Mine. 
8:15 After you have purified them and presented them as a wave offering, the Levites will come to do their work at the Tent of Meeting. 
8:16 . I have taken them for Myself. 
8:17  is Mine, whether human or animal. On the day I struck down the firstborn of the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for Myself. 
8:18 , 
8:19  in the Tent of Meeting, and to make atonement for them—so that there would be no plague among them for coming too close to the Sanctuary.” 
8:20  did to them. 
8:21 , and, he made atonement for them to purify them. 
8:22  had commanded Moses concerning the Levites. 
8:23  again spoke to Moses saying, 
8:24 “This is for the Levites. Men 25 years old and upward are to present themselves for service to work in the Tent of Meeting. 
8:25 But at the age of 50 he is to retire from his service and work no longer. 
8:26 He may assist his brothers in the Tent of Meeting to do their duties, but he himself will no longer do the work. Thus, you are to assign to the Levites their responsibilities.”
9:1  spoke to Moses in the Sinai wilderness in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt saying, 
9:2  is to observe Passover at its appointed time. 
9:3 You are to celebrate it at its appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month, with all its rules and regulations.” 
9:4  to observe Passover. 
9:5  did. 
9:6 However, there were some men who could not celebrate Passover because of being defiled by a dead body. So they came to Moses and Aaron on that same day, 
9:7 ?” 
9:8  commands concerning you.” 
9:9  spoke to Moses saying, 
9:10 ’s Passover. 
9:11  and bitter herbs they are to eat it. 
9:12 They are not to leave any of it until morning, or break any bones. When they celebrate Passover they are to observe all its regulations. 
9:13 ’s offering at the appointed time. That man will bear his sin. 
9:14  according to the requirement, so he should do. There will be for you the same regulation for the outsider and the native of the land.’”
9:15 On the day the Tabernacle was erected, the cloud covered the Tabernacle. By evening until morning, the cloud above the Tent of Testimony had an appearance like fire. 
9:16 It was that way continually. The cloud covered it, and by night it appeared like fire. 
9:17  would encamp. 
9:18  they would encamp. All the days that the cloud remained over the Tabernacle, they would remain in camp. 
9:19  and not set out. 
9:20 ’s word they would set out. 
9:21 At times the cloud remained only from evening until morning. When the cloud would lift, they would set out. Whether by day or by night, when the cloud lifted, they would set out. 
9:22  remained camped and would not set out. But when it would lift, they would set out. 
9:23 ’s order by Moses’s hand.
10:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
10:2 “Make two trumpets of hammered silver for yourself. They are for summoning the community and having the camps set out. 
10:3 Whenever both are sounded, the whole community is to gather toward you at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. 
10:4 But if only one is sounded, the princes—the heads of the tribes of Israel—are to gather toward you. 
10:5 When you sound the trumpet the first time, the camp of those camped on the east is to set out. 
10:6 When you sound the trumpet blast the second time, the camp of those camped on the south is to set out. Short blasts will be the signal for their moving out. 
10:7 To gather the whole national community, you are to sound the sustained blasts, but not the short blasts. 
10:8  will blow the trumpets. This is to be an eternal ordinance for you as well as for your generations to come. 
10:9  your God and be delivered from your enemies. 
10:10  your God!”
10:11 On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud lifted up from above the Tabernacle of the Testimony. 
10:12  set out on their travels in the Sinai wilderness. The cloud came to rest in the wilderness of Paran. 
10:13  by Moses’s hand. 
10:14 The standard of the camp of the sons of Judah set out first by their divisions. Over them was Nahshon son of Amminadab. 
10:15 Over the division of the tribe of the sons of Issachar was Nethanel son of Zuar. 
10:16 Over the division of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun was Eliab son of Helon. 
10:17 Then the Tabernacle was disassembled, and the sons of Gershon and Merari, who were carrying it, set out. 
10:18 The standard of the camp of Reuben then set out, by their divisions. Over his division was Elizur son of Shedeur. 
10:19 Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai, was over the division of the tribe of the sons of Simeon. 
10:20 Over the division of the tribe of the sons of Gad was Eliasaph son of Deuel. 
10:21 Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy items. The Tabernacle was to be erected before their arrival. 
10:22 The standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim set out next, by their divisions. Over his division was Elishama son of Ammihud. 
10:23 Over the division of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh was Gamaliel son of Pedahzur. 
10:24 Over the division of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin was Abidan son of Gideoni. 
10:25 The standard of the camp of the tribe of the sons of Dan, being the rear guard of all the camps, set out by their divisions. Over his division was Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai. 
10:26 Pagiel son of Ochran, was over the division of the tribe of the sons of Asher. 
10:27 Ahira son of Enan, was over the division of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali. 
10:28 , by their divisions, set out. 
10:29  has spoken goodness to Israel.” 
10:30 But he said to him, “I will not go, because I would rather go to my own country and to my own people.” 
10:31 But he said, “Do not leave us now, because you know where we should camp in the wilderness. You can be like eyes to us. 
10:32  gives to us.” 
10:33  going ahead of them for those three days to seek out a resting place for them. 
10:34  was over them by day when they advanced from the camp. 
10:35 ! May Your enemies be scattered! May those who hate You flee from before You!” 
10:36 , to the myriad thousands of Israel!”
11:1  blazed among them, ravaging the outskirts of the camp. 
11:2  and the fire died out. 
11:3  had burned among them. 
11:4  began to wail repeatedly, saying, “If we could just eat some meat! 
11:5 We remember the fish that we used to eat in Egypt, for free—the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic! 
11:6  .” 
11:7  was similar to coriander seed and had an appearance like gum resin. 
11:8 The people went about, gathered it up, and ground it in a hand mill or crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into cakes. It had a taste like something made with olive oil. 
11:9  descended with it. 
11:10 ’s anger became very hot, and Moses was troubled. 
11:11 , “Why have You brought trouble on Your servant? Haven’t I found favor in Your eyes—that You laid the burden of all these people on me? 
11:12 Did I conceive all these people, or did I give birth to them, that You should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom just as the nurse carries an infant’—to the land You promised to their fathers? 
11:13 Where can I get meat for all these people? For they wail to me saying, ‘Give us meat to eat!’ 
11:14 I am not able to carry all these people by myself! The load is too heavy for me! 
11:15 If this is how You are treating me, kill me now! If I have found favor in Your eyes, kill me please—don’t let me see my own misery!” 
11:16  said to Moses, “Bring me 70 of the elders of Israel whom you know to be elders of the people and their leaders. Take them to the Tent of Meeting, so they may stand with you there. 
11:17  that is on you and will place it on them. They will carry with you the burden of the people, so you will not be carrying it alone.” 
11:18  will give you meat and you will eat! 
11:19 You will eat—not for one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days, 
11:20  who is among you, and you wailed to His face saying, ‘Why did we ever leave Egypt?” 
11:21 Moses then said, “600,000 foot soldiers—the people I am in the middle of---yet You say, ‘I am going to give them meat to eat for an entire month?’ 
11:22 If flocks and herds were slaughtered, would they have enough? Or if all the fish in the sea were caught, would they have enough?” 
11:23 ’s arm too short? Now you will see whether My word will come true for you or not.”
11:24 ’s words. He gathered 70 of the elders of the people and had them stand around the Tent. 
11:25  first rested on them, they prophesied—but never again. 
11:26  rested on them. They were among those listed, but they had not gone out to the Tent. So they prophesied in the camp. 
11:27 A young man ran and told Moses and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!” 
11:28 Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses since his youth, cried out and said, “Moses, my lord, stop them!” 
11:29  would put the Spirit on all of them!” 
11:30 Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
11:31  and drove quails from the sea. He brought them into the camp to about a day’s journey in any direction, about two cubits above the ground all around the camp. 
11:32 The people went out all that day and all that night and all the following day and collected quail. No one gathered less than ten omers. They spread them out all around the camp. 
11:33  struck the people with a severe plague. 
11:34 For that reason the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah , because they buried the people who were craving. 
11:35 From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth and stayed in Hazeroth.
12:1 Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses on account of the Cushite woman he married, because he had married a Cushite woman. 
12:2  heard it. 
12:3 Now the man Moses was very humble, more so than anyone on the face of the earth. 
12:4  said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, “The three of you, come out to the Tent of Meeting.” So the three came out. 
12:5  descended in a column of cloud, stood at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and called to Aaron and Miriam. The two of them stepped forward. 
12:6 , I reveal Myself in a vision, I speak to him in a dream. 
12:7 Not so with My servant Moses. In all My house, he is faithful. 
12:8 ! Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?” 
12:9 ’s anger burned against them, and He left them. 
12:10 , like snow! As Aaron turned toward her, behold, she had tza’arat! 
12:11 He said to Moses, “Please, my lord, don’t hold against us the sin we have committed so foolishly! 
12:12 Don’t let her be like a stillborn baby, who comes from his mother’s womb with his flesh half-eaten away!” 
12:13  saying, “O God, heal her now!” 
12:14  said to Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not be in shame for seven days? Let her be confined outside the camp for seven days. After that she may be brought back.” 
12:15 So Miriam was restricted to outside the camp for seven days. The people did not move on until Miriam was brought back. 
12:16 Afterward, the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the Wilderness of Paran.
13:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
13:2 . Each man you are to send will be a prince of the tribe of his fathers, a man from each tribe.” 
13:3 . 
13:4 These are their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur. 
13:5 From the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori. 
13:6 From the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh. 
13:7 From the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph. 
13:8 From the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun. 
13:9 From the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu. 
13:10 From the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi. 
13:11 From the tribe of Manasseh, part of the tribe of Joseph, Gaddi son of Susi. 
13:12 From the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli. 
13:13 From the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael. 
13:14 From the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi. 
13:15 From the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Machi. 
13:16 These are the names of the men Moses sent to investigate the land. (Now he gave Hoshea son of Nun, the name Joshua.) 
13:17 As he sent them to explore the land of Canaan, he said to them, “Go up there through the Negev, then go up into the hill country. 
13:18 See what the land is like and the people living there, whether they might be strong or weak, few or many. 
13:19 In what kind of land are they living? Is it good or bad? Also, what about the cities in which they are living? Are they unwalled or do they have fortifications? 
13:20 How is the soil—fertile or poor? Are there trees on it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land.” (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.) 
13:21 So they went up and explored the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob the entrance of Hamath. 
13:22 They continued on up through the Negev and came to Hebron. There lived Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, descendants of Anak. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
13:23 When they reached as far as the Valley of Eshcol, they cut a single branch with a cluster of grapes. It was carried on a pole between two of them. They also cut some pomegranates and some figs. 
13:24 . 
13:25 They returned from investigating the land after 40 days. 
13:26  at Kadesh in the wilderness of Paran. They gave their report to them and the entire assembly. They showed the land’s fruit. 
13:27 They gave their account to him and said, “We went into the land where you sent us. Indeed it is flowing with milk and honey—this is some of its fruit. 
13:28 Except, the people living in the land are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw the sons of Anak there! 
13:29 Amalek is living in the land of the Negev, the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites are living in the mountains, and the Canaanites are living near the sea and along the bank of the Jordan.” 
13:30 Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, “We should definitely go up and capture the land, for we can certainly do it!” 
13:31 But the men who had gone up with him said, “We cannot attack these people, because they are stronger than we.” 
13:32  a bad report about the land they had explored, saying, “The land through which we passed to explore devours its residents. All the people we saw there are men of great size! 
13:33  .) We seemed like grasshoppers in our eyes as well as theirs!”
14:1 All through that night, the entire community raised up their voices. The people wept. 
14:2  grumbled against Moses and Aaron and the whole community said, “If only we had died in Egypt! If only we had died in this wilderness! 
14:3  bringing us to this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be like plunder! Wouldn’t it be better for us to return to Egypt?” 
14:4 They said to each other, “Let’s choose a leader and let’s go back to Egypt!” 
14:5 . 
14:6 Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes. 
14:7 , “The land through which we passed is an exceptionally good land! 
14:8  is pleased with us, He will lead us into that land and will give it to us—a land flowing with milk and honey. 
14:9  is with us! Do not fear them.” 
14:10 . 
14:11  said to Moses, “How long will these people treat Me contemptibly? How long will they neglect to trust in Me—in spite of all the miraculous signs I have performed among them? 
14:12 I will strike them with the plague. I will destroy them. But you I will make into a nation greater and stronger than they!” 
14:13 , “The Egyptians will hear about it, because You brought up this people by Your power from among them. 
14:14 , have been seen eye to eye, that Your cloud remains over them, and that in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night You go before them. 
14:15 If you kill these people all at once, the nations who have heard this report about You will say, 
14:16  was unable to bring this people to the land He had promised them, He has slaughtered them in the wilderness.’ 
14:17  show His strength, just as You have spoken saying, 
14:18  is slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression. Still, He does not leave the guilty unpunished, bringing the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations.’ 
14:19 Forgive now the guiltiness of this people in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness, just as You have pardoned this people from Egypt until now!” 
14:20  answered, “I have forgiven them just as you have spoken. 
14:21  fills the entire earth, 
14:22 none of the people who saw My glory and My miraculous signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness—yet tested Me these ten times and did not obey My Voice—
14:23 not one of them will see the land I promised to their forefathers. None of those who treated Me with contempt will see it! 
14:24 However, My servant Caleb, because a different spirit is with him and he is wholeheartedly behind Me, I will bring him into the land where he went—his offspring will inherit it. 
14:25 Now since the Amalekites and Canaanites are inhabiting the valley, turn back tomorrow and set out by the wilderness route toward the Sea of Reeds.” 
14:26  then said to Moses and Aaron saying, 
14:27  grumbling against Me. 
14:28 , ‘I will do to you just as I heard you say in My ears. 
14:29 In this very wilderness your bodies will drop—every one of you 20 years of age and older who was numbered in the census and grumbled against Me. 
14:30 Not one of you will enter the land about which I lifted My hand to make home for you—except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. 
14:31 “As for your children—whom you said would be like plunder—I will bring them in and they will experience the land that you spurned. 
14:32 But your bodies will drop in this wilderness. 
14:33 Your children will be herdsmen in the wilderness for 40 years. They will suffer because of your unfaithfulness until your corpses are consumed in the wilderness. 
14:34 For 40 years, corresponding to the number of the 40 days you explored the land—one year for each day—you will suffer for your iniquities and know My hostility. 
14:35 , have spoken and certainly will I do this to all this wicked community banding together against Me. In this wilderness they will meet their end and there they will die!” 
14:36 Then the men whom Moses had sent to explore the land, who had returned and caused the whole community to grumble against him by spreading a bad report about the land, 
14:37 ’s presence. 
14:38 Of those men who had gone to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived. 
14:39 , the people mourned bitterly. 
14:40  promised. For we have sinned.” 
14:41 ? That will never succeed. 
14:42  will not be among you and you will be defeated before your enemies! 
14:43 .” 
14:44 ’s covenant nor Moses moved from within the camp. 
14:45 The Amalekites and Canaanites living in the mountain country came down, attacked them, and beat them down all the way to Hormah.
15:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
15:2  and say to them: When you enter the land that I am giving you where you will make your homes, 
15:3 , from the herd or from the flock, 
15:4 the one bringing the offering is to present a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil. 
15:5 “Now with each lamb for the burnt offering or sacrifice, you are to prepare a fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering. 
15:6 With a ram, you are to prepare two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil, 
15:7 . 
15:8 , 
15:9 bring with the young bull a grain offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil. 
15:10 . 
15:11 This is to be done for each bull or ram, for each young goat or lamb. 
15:12 Do this for each one, for as many as you prepare. 
15:13 . 
15:14 , as you do, he must do exactly the same as you are doing. 
15:15 . 
15:16  and the same regulations will apply to both you and the outsider residing among you.” 
15:17  spoke to Moses saying, 
15:18 . Say to them: When you enter the land to which I am taking you, 
15:19 . 
15:20 You are to offer a cake from the first of your ground-up meal as an offering from your threshing floor—so you are to lift it up. 
15:21 Throughout your generations to come, you are to give this offering from the first of your ground-up meal.
15:22  related to Moses 
15:23  commanded and onward throughout your generations— 
15:24 , along with its appropriate grain offering and drink offering, and one male goat as a sin offering. 
15:25  for their error. 
15:26  along with the outsider residing among them will be forgiven, for all the people were involved in unintentional wrongdoing. 
15:27 “If but one person should sin unintentionally, he is to bring a year-old female goat for a sin offering. 
15:28  for that person who erred by sinning without intent, and he is to be forgiven when atonement has been made for him. 
15:29  applies to you for the one sinning unintentionally. 
15:30  and that person is to be cut off from his people. 
15:31  and has broken His commandment, that person will certainly be cut off—his guilt will remain on him.” 
15:32  were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering wood on the Shabbat. 
15:33 Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses, Aaron and the entire assembly. 
15:34 They kept him under arrest, not being clear what was to be done to him. 
15:35  said to Moses, “The man has to die. The whole assembly is to stone him with stones outside the camp.” 
15:36  commanded Moses.
15:37  spoke to Moses saying, 
15:38 . 
15:39  and do them and not go spying out after your own hearts and your own eyes, prostituting yourselves. 
15:40  and you will be holy to your God. 
15:41  your God.”
16:1 Now Korah, son of Izhar son of Kohath son of Levi, and sons of Reuben—Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth—
16:2 , men of renown who had been appointed to the council. 
16:3 ?” 
16:4 When Moses heard this, he fell on his face. 
16:5  will reveal who is His and who is holy. The one whom He will let come near to Him will be the one He chooses to come near to Him. 
16:6 Do this, Korah and your whole following! Take for yourselves censers. 
16:7  chooses will be the holy one! You sons of Levi are the ones who have gone too far!” 
16:8 Moses also said to Korah, “Listen now, sons of Levi! 
16:9  and to stand before the community to minister to them? 
16:10 So He brought you close, along with all your fellow sons of Levi. But you are seeking the priesthood, too! 
16:11 ! Who then is Aaron—that you are grumbling against him?” 
16:12 Then Moses sent word to call Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab. But they said, “We will not come! 
16:13 Isn’t it enough that you brought us from a land flowing with milk and honey, only to kill us in the wilderness? And now you would lord it over us? 
16:14 What’s more, you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Would you now gouge out the eyes of those men? We won’t come!” 
16:15 , “Do not accept their offering. I haven’t taken from them a single donkey, nor have I wronged one of them!” 
16:16 —you, they and Aaron—tomorrow! 
16:17 , you and Aaron each presenting his censer.” 
16:18 So each man took his censer, put fire and incense into it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. 
16:19  appeared to the entire assembly. 
16:20  spoke to Moses and Aaron saying, 
16:21 “Separate yourselves from among this assembly, so that I may consume them at once!” 
16:22 But they fell on their faces and cried out, “O God, God of the spirits of all flesh, if one man sins, will you be angry with the entire community?” 
16:23  spoke to Moses saying, 
16:24 “Speak to the assembly saying, ‘Move away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan and Abiram!’” 
16:25 Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram. The elders of Israel followed after him. 
16:26 He warned the assembly saying, “Move away from the tents of these wicked men! Don’t touch anything that is theirs, or you will be swept away because of all their sins!” 
16:27 So they moved away from near the dwelling of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram came outside and were standing at the entrance of their tents with their wives, their children, and their little ones. 
16:28  has sent me to do all these works, that they are not from my own heart. 
16:29  has not sent me. 
16:30 .” 
16:31 As soon as he finished saying all these things, the ground split under them. 
16:32 The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, along with all their households, all of Korah’s people and all their possessions. 
16:33 , they and everything that was theirs. The earth closed over them and they were gone from among the community. 
16:34 All Israel around them fled at their outcry, for they shouted, “Perhaps the earth will swallow us!” 
16:35  and consumed the 250 men offering the incense. 
16:36  spoke to Moses saying, 
16:37 , to take the censers from the burning, because they are holy, and scatter the coals at a distance. 
16:38 .” 
16:39  collected the bronze censers brought by the ones who were burned and hammered them into an overlay for the altar, 
16:40 , and so no one would become like Korah and his following. 
16:41 ’s people!” 
16:42 But when they gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the Tent of Meeting, behold, the cloud covered it and the glory appeared! 
16:43 Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting. 
16:44  spoke to Moses saying, 
16:45 “Get away from among this assembly so that I may immediately consume them!” So they fell on their faces. 
16:46  and the plague has started.” 
16:47 Aaron did just as Moses had said, and ran into the middle of the assembly. Behold, the plague had already started among the people. But he offered the incense and made atonement for the people. 
16:48 He stood between the dead and the living and the plague stopped. 
16:49 However, there were 14,700 dead from the plague, besides those who died because of Korah. 
16:50 Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, when the plague had been halted.
17:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
17:2  and get a rod from each ancestral house, twelve staffs in all, from each prince according to his ancestral household. Write each man’s name on his staff. 
17:3 Write Aaron’s name on Levi’s staff, for there is to be one staff for the prince of each tribe. 
17:4 Then you are to place them in the Tent of Meeting, before the Testimony, where I meet with you. 
17:5 , who are grumbling against you.” 
17:6 . Each of their princes gave him a staff, one staff for each prince according to their ancestral houses, twelve staffs in all, and Aaron’s staff was among them. 
17:7  in the Tent of Testimony. 
17:8 The next day, Moses entered the Tent of Testimony and behold, Aaron’s staff, from the house of Levi, had sprouted, blossomed, and produced almonds! 
17:9 . They looked and each man took his staff. 
17:10  said to Moses, “Put Aaron’s staff back in front of the Testimony to keep as a sign to the sons of rebellion, so that it may put an end to their grumblings against Me, and so they will not die.” 
17:11  had commanded him. 
17:12  said to Moses saying, “Look! We will die! We are all lost! We are lost! 
17:13  will die! Must all of us die?”
18:1  said to Aaron, “You, your sons, and the house of your father with you will bear the guilt for the Sanctuary, and you and your sons will bear the guilt for your priesthood. 
18:2 Bring with you your brothers, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, so that they may join you and assist you, both you and your sons with you, before the Tent of the Testimony. 
18:3 They are to perform their duties for you and for all matters related to the Tent. They must not approach the implements of the Sanctuary or the altar—otherwise, both you and they will die. 
18:4 They are to team with you and attend to the Tent of Meeting, for all the service of the Tent. But no unauthorized person may intrude upon you. 
18:5 . 
18:6  to serve in the work of the Tent of Meeting. 
18:7  . I am giving you the ministry of the priesthood as a gift. Anyone unauthorized who approaches will die.” 
18:8  I have given to you as set aside for you and your sons as a permanent share. 
18:9 You are to have the part of the most holy things that is kept from the fire. Whether grain, sin or guilt offerings that they bring to Me as most holy—they are for you and your sons. 
18:10 You are to eat it as most holy. Every male may eat it— it is set apart for you. 
18:11 . I have given all the wave offerings as a permanent share to you, your sons and your daughters. Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it. 
18:12  from their firstfruits, I have given them to you. 
18:13  will be for yours. Anyone who is clean in your house may eat it. 
18:14 Every devoted thing in Israel is yours. 
18:15 , is yours. However, you are to redeem the firstborn of man and the firstborn of unclean animals. 
18:16 When they are a month old, you are to redeem them at the redemption price of five shekels of silver by the Sanctuary shekel, or 20 gerahs. 
18:17 . 
18:18 Their meat—the breast of the wave offering and the right thigh—is yours. 
18:19  for you and your offspring.” 
18:20 . 
18:21 See, I have given all the tithes in Israel to the sons of Levi as an inheritance in return for all the work of the service they are doing in the Tent of Meeting. 
18:22  must never trespass the Tent of Meeting, or they will bear the consequences of their sin and die. 
18:23  they are to receive no inheritance. 
18:24 .” 
18:25  spoke to Moses saying, 
18:26  a tithe of that tithe. 
18:27 Your offering will be reckoned as grain from the threshing floor or the fullness of the winepress. 
18:28 . 
18:29 ’s portion. 
18:30 “Say to them: When you present the best part, it will be reckoned to the Levites as the produce of the threshing floor and of the winepress. 
18:31 You and your household may eat it in any place. It is your wage for your service in the Tent of Meeting. 
18:32 , so you will not die.”
19:1  spoke to Moses and Aaron saying, 
19:2  that they bring to you a flawless red heifer on which there is no blemish and on which has never been a yoke. 
19:3 . He will take her outside the camp and slaughter her in his presence. 
19:4  is to take some of the blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the Tent of Meeting. 
19:5 “While watching, he is to burn the heifer, her hide, flesh, blood and refuse. 
19:6  is to take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet wool, and cast them into the midst of the burning heifer. 
19:7  will be unclean until evening. 
19:8 Also the one burning it is to wash his clothes and bathe his flesh with the water, and he will be unclean until evening. 
19:9  to use as water of purification from sin. 
19:10  and for the outsider living among them. 
19:11 “Whoever touches any dead body will be unclean for seven days. 
19:12 He is to purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day. Then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third and seventh days, he will not be clean. 
19:13 ’s Tabernacle, and that person will be cut off from Israel. Because the cleansing water was not sprinkled on him, he is unclean and his uncleanness will remain on him. 
19:14  for whenever a person dies in a tent. Anyone entering the tent or anyone inside the tent will be unclean seven days. 
19:15 Any open container not having a lid fastened on it will also be unclean. 
19:16 Anyone out in the open field who touches a dead body, whether killed by a sword or was killed by a natural cause, or touches a human bone or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. 
19:17 “For the unclean one, they are to take some of the ash of the burnt purification offering, and pour some fresh water into a jar. 
19:18 Then a clean person will take some hyssop, dip it into the water, and, sprinkle it on the tent, all of the furnishings, and the people who were there, as well as the one touching the bone, the one killed, the corpse or the grave. 
19:19 The clean person will sprinkle the unclean one on the third and seventh days. He is to purify himself on the seventh day, and on the seventh day he is to wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and at evening he will be clean.
19:20 , since the cleansing water was not sprinkled on him. He is unclean. 
19:21 This will be a permanent ordinance for them. The one sprinkling the cleansing water is also to wash his clothes, and anyone touching the cleansing water will be unclean until evening. 
19:22 Anything touched by an unclean person becomes unclean, and anyone touching it will be unclean until evening.”
20:1  arrived at the wilderness of Zin. The people stayed at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried. 
20:2 Now there was no water for the community, so they assembled against Moses and Aaron. 
20:3 ! 
20:4  into this wilderness, for us and our livestock to die here? 
20:5 Why have you brought us from Egypt to bring us to this evil place—a place without grain, fig, grapevine or pomegranate—and there’s no water to drink!” 
20:6  appeared to them. 
20:7  spoke to Moses saying, 
20:8 “Take the staff and gather the assembly, you and your brother Aaron. Speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will give out its water. You will bring out water from the rock, and you will give the community something to drink, along with their livestock.” 
20:9 , just as He had commanded him. 
20:10 Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock. He said, “Listen now, you rebels! Must we bring you water from this rock?” 
20:11 Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with the staff. Water gushed out and the community and its livestock drank. 
20:12 , therefore you will not bring this assembly into the land that I have given to them.” 
20:13  showed Himself holy among them.
20:14 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom. “Thus says your brother, Israel: ‘You know all the hardship that came on us. 
20:15 Our forefathers went down to Egypt, so we lived there for a very long time. The Egyptians mistreated us, and our fathers. 
20:16 , He heard our cry, sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. See now, we are at Kadesh, a town on the frontier of your territory. 
20:17 Permit us to pass through your territory. We will not cross through any field or vineyard or drink water of any well. But we will travel on the king’s highway. We will not deviate to the right or left until we will have passed through your territory.’” 
20:18 But Edom said to him, “You may not pass through me—or I will march out against you with the sword.” 
20:19  then said to him, “We will travel on the main road, and if we or our livestock even drink any of your water, we will pay its price. It’s nothing, just to pass through on foot!” 
20:20 He answered, “You may not pass through!” Yet Edom came out to oppose them with a large and well-armed people. 
20:21 Since Edom refused to permit Israel to cross through her territory, Israel turned away from them.
20:22  set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor. 
20:23  said to Moses and Aaron, 
20:24 , because you rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah. 
20:25 Take Aaron and his son Eleazar, and take them up Mount Hor. 
20:26 Remove Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, and Aaron will be gathered up and will die there.” 
20:27  commanded. They ascended Mount Hor before the eyes of the whole community. 
20:28 Moses removed Aaron’s garments and placed them on Eleazar his son. Aaron died there at the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar descended the mountain. 
20:29 When they saw that Aaron had died, the entire community mourned Aaron 30 days.
21:1 When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked Israel and captured some of them. 
21:2  and stated, “If you deliver this people into our hand, we will put their cities under the ban of destruction!” 
21:3  listened to Israel’s plea and delivered up the Canaanites. They put them and their cities under the ban of destruction. So the name of the place was called Hormah. 
21:4 They travelled from Mount Hor along the route to the Sea of Reeds in order to go around the land of Edom. The spirit of the people became impatient along the way. 
21:5 The people spoke against God and Moses: “Why have you brought us from Egypt to die in the wilderness, because there is no bread, no water, and our very spirits detest the despicable food? 
21:6  sent poisonous serpents among the people, and they bit the people and many of the people of Israel died. 
21:7  for us, that He may take away the snakes!” So Moses prayed for the people. 
21:8  said to Moses, “Make yourself a fiery snake and put it on a pole. Whenever anyone who has been bitten will look at it, he will live.” 
21:9 So Moses made a bronze snake and put it on a pole, and it happened that whenever a snake bit anyone and he looked at the bronze snake, he lived. 
21:10  moved on and encamped at Oboth. 
21:11 Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Ije-abarim, in the wilderness facing Moab toward the sunrise. 
21:12 From there they set out and camped in the Wadi Zered. 
21:13 They set out from there and camped along the Arnon, which is in the wilderness extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is also the border between Moab and the Amorites. 
21:14 , “...Vaheb in Suphah and the wadis of the Arnon, 
21:15 and the slope of the wadis that leads to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab—” 
21:16  said to Moses, “Gather the people and I will give them water.” 
21:17 Then Israel sang this song, “Spring up, O well! Sing about it!” 
21:18 The well the princes dug, that the nobles of the people sank with their scepter and their staffs.” From the wilderness they went on to Mattanah. 
21:19 From Mattanah they went on to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 
21:20 and from Bamoth to the valley in the field of Moab where the peak of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland.
21:21 Israel sent messengers to King Sihon of the Amorites saying, 
21:22 “Permit us to pass through your land. We will not turn aside into field or vineyard nor drink water from the wells. We will travel on the king’s highway until we will have passed through your territory.” 
21:23 But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. Instead, Sihon called out his entire army and marched out into the desert to oppose Israel. When he came to Jahaz, he fought against Israel. 
21:24 But Israel struck him by the sword’s edge and conquered his land from Arnon to Jabbok as far as the Ammonites, because the border of the sons of Ammon was fortified. 
21:25 Israel conquered all these cities and occupied all the Amorite cities, Heshbon and all its towns. 
21:26 Heshbon was the city of King Sihon of the Amorites, who had fought with the former king of Moab and had taken from his control all the land as far as the Arnon. 
21:27 Therefore the poets say, “Come to Heshbon! Let her be rebuilt! Let the city of Sihon be restored! 
21:28 For fire went out from Heshbon, a blaze from the city of Sihon! It consumed Ar of Moab, the masters of Arnon’s heights! 
21:29 Woe to you, O Moab! You have been destroyed, people of Chemosh! He has given up his sons as refugees and his daughters as captives to Sihon, king of the Amorites. 
21:30 But we overthrew them! Heshbon as far as Dibon is destroyed! We have demolished them as far as Nophah up to Medeba.” 
21:31 So Israel was living in the land of the Amorites. 
21:32 After Moses sent spies to Jazer, they captured her towns and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
21:33 Then they turned and went up the road to the Bashan. Og, king of the Bashan, went out to confront them, he and all his people, in battle at Edrei. 
21:34  said to Moses, “Do not fear him. I have given him with all his people and his land into your hand. You are to do to him just as you did to Sihon, the Amorite king who was living in Heshbon.” 
21:35 So they struck him and his sons and his entire army until no survivor was left to him, and they possessed his land.
22:1  set out and camped in the plains of Moab alongside the Jordan across from Jericho.
22:2  had done to the Amorites, 
22:3 . 
22:4 Moab said to the elders of Midian, “The multitude will lick up everything around us like the ox licks up the grass of the field.” Now Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. 
22:5 He sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, at Pethor near the River in his native land, saying to him, “Look now, a people has come out of Egypt. See now, they cover the surface of the earth and are settling beside me. 
22:6 Come now, curse this people for me, because they are too strong for me! Perhaps I may be able to defeat them and drive them away from the country. I know that whoever you bless will be blessed and whoever you curse will be accursed!” 
22:7 The elders of Moab and Midian left with divination fees in their hand. When they came to Balaam, they told him Balak’s words. 
22:8  speaks to me.” So the officials of Moab stayed with Balaam. 
22:9 God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?” 
22:10 Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent word to me: 
22:11 See, the people coming out of Egypt cover the surface of the land. Come now, curse them for me. Perhaps I will be able to fight against them and drive them away!” 
22:12 God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them! Do not curse them, for they are blessed!” 
22:13  has refused to let me go with you.” 
22:14 So the Moabite officials got up, went back to Balak, and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.” 
22:15 Balak again sent other dignitaries, more numerous and honored than these previous ones. 
22:16 They also came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak son of Zippor: Please let nothing keep you from coming to me! 
22:17 I will richly reward you, and everything you tell me I will do! Just come now and curse this people for me!” 
22:18  my God, to do anything small or great! 
22:19  may say to me.” 
22:20 God came to Balaam by night and said to him, “Since the men came to you to summon you, arise and go with them. However, only the word I tell you are you to do!” 
22:21 So Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the Moabite princes. 
22:22  stood in the road to oppose him—he was riding on his donkey and two of his servants were with him—
22:23  standing in the road with his drawn sword in his hand, the donkey turned off the road and went into the field. So Balaam beat the donkey to get her back onto the road. 
22:24  stood in a narrow path between two vineyards, with a wall on this side and a wall on that side. 
22:25 , she pressed against the wall, crushing Balaam’s foot against the wall. So Balaam continued beating her. 
22:26 The angel again moved. He stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, right or left. 
22:27 , she lay down under Balaam. Balaam was very angry and beat the donkey with his staff. 
22:28  opened the donkey’s mouth and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you that you have beaten me these three times?” 
22:29 Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you’ve made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you now!” 
22:30 The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey which you have ridden as always to this day? Have I ever been in the habit of doing this to you?” “No,” he said. 
22:31  standing in the road with his drawn sword in his hand. So he fell on his face. 
22:32  said to him, “Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? Behold, I came as an adversary because your way before Me is a reckless one! 
22:33 The donkey saw Me and turned away from Me these three times. If she had not turned away from Me, by now I would have killed you indeed, but let her live!” 
22:34 , “I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now, if this is displeasing in your eyes, I will go back home.” 
22:35  said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but speak only the word that I tell you.” So Balaam went with Balak’s princes. 
22:36 When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to greet him at the Moabite city on the border of the Arnon, the frontier of the territory. 
22:37 Balak said to Balaam, “Didn’t I send you an urgent summons? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I really unable to reward you?” 
22:38 “Look, I have come to you now!” Balaam said to Balak. “Can I just say anything? I must speak only the message which God puts into my mouth.” 
22:39 Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath-huzoth. 
22:40 Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep and sent some to Balaam and the princes who were with him. 
22:41 In the morning, Balak took Balaam with him to Bamoth-baal, and from there he saw part of the people.
23:1 Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.” 
23:2 So Balak did just as Balaam had said. Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
23:3  will meet me. Whatever message He shows me, I will tell you. Then he went to a barren height. 
23:4 God met with Balaam and he said to Him, “I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I offered a bull and a ram.” 
23:5  put a message into Balaam’s mouth and said, “Return to Balak and speak this.” 
23:6 Balaam went back to him. Behold, he was standing beside his offering with all the princes of Moab. 
23:7 Then he uttered his oracle and said, “From Aram, Balak brought me, Moab’s king from the mountains of the east: ‘Come! Curse Jacob for me! ‘Come! Denounce Israel!’ 
23:8  has not denounced? 
23:9 From the rocky peaks I see him. From the heights I behold him. Look, he lives as a nation apart, and does not consider himself as being like the other nations. 
23:10 Who can count Jacob’s dust? Who can number a fourth of Israel? Let my soul die the death of the upright, and let my end be like his!” 
23:11 Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but look, you’ve actually blessed them!” 
23:12  puts into my mouth?” 
23:13 Then Balak said to him, “Come now with me to another place where you can see a part of them only, not all of them. Curse them for me from there.” 
23:14 He took him to Lookout Field on top of Pisgah. He built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
23:15 “Stay here beside your offering,” he said to Balak, “while I am meeting over there.” 
23:16  met Balaam there and put a message into his mouth, and said, “Return to Balak and speak thus.” 
23:17  say?” 
23:18 So he uttered his oracle and said: “Rise, Balak! Hear me, son of Zippor! 
23:19 God is not a man who lies, or a son of man who changes his mind! Does He speak and then not do it, or promise and not fulfill it? 
23:20 Look, I received a command to bless. He has blessed—I cannot change it! 
23:21  their God is with them —the King’s shout is among them! 
23:22 God is bringing them from Egypt with the strong horns of the wild ox! 
23:23 There is no sorcery effective against Jacob, nor any divination against Israel! Now it will be said of Jacob and Israel, ‘See what God has done!’ 
23:24 The people rise like a lioness, like a lion who does not rest until he eats his prey and drinks his victim’s blood!” 
23:25 Then Balak said to Balaam, “Do not curse them or bless them at all!” 
23:26  says, I must do?’ 
23:27 Balak said to Balaam, “Come with me to another place. Perhaps it will be pleasing to God and you may curse them for me from there.” 
23:28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland. 
23:29 Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.” 
23:30 Balak did just as Balaam said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
24:1  to bless Israel, he did not resort to sorceries as at the other times, but turned his face toward the wilderness. 
24:2  came over him. 
24:3 He uttered his oracle and said: “This is the oracle of Balaam son of Beor, and the oracle of a strong man whose eye has been opened, 
24:4 the oracle of one hearing God’s speech, one seeing Shaddai’s vision, one fallen down, yet with open eyes: 
24:5 How lovely are your tents, O Jacob, and your dwellings, O Israel! 
24:6 , like cedars beside the waters. 
24:7 Water will flow from his buckets, his seed by abundant water. His king will be greater than Agag , his kingdom will be exalted. 
24:8 God is bringing him out of Egypt. like the strong horns of a wild ox. He devours nations hostile to him. He will crush their bones. His arrows will pierce them. 
24:9 He crouches like a lion or a lioness— who would rouse him? He who blesses you will be blessed, and he who curses you will be cursed.” 
24:10 Then Balak became furious at Balaam, and struck his hands together. Balak said to Balaam, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but look, you have blessed them these three times! 
24:11  has kept you from reward!” 
24:12 Balaam answered Balak, “Didn’t I indeed tell your messengers whom you sent to me saying: 
24:13  may speak, I will speak!’ 
24:14 Now, behold, I am going back to my people. Come, let me counsel you what these people will do to your people in the latter days. 
24:15 Then he uttered his oracle: The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the strong man whose eye is opened, 
24:16 the oracle of one hearing God’s speech, one experiencing Elyon’s knowledge, one seeing Shaddai’s vision, one fallen down, yet with open eyes: 
24:17 ‘I see him, yet not at this moment. I behold him, yet not in this location. For a star will come from Jacob, a scepter will arise from Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab and the skulls of all the sons of Seth. 
24:18 Edom will be conquered— his enemies will conquer Seir, but Israel will triumph. 
24:19 One from Jacob will rule and destroy the city’s survivors.” 
24:20 Then he saw Amalek, so he uttered his oracle and said: “Amalek was the first of nations, but will come to ruin at last.” 
24:21 Then he saw the Kenite, so he uttered his oracle and said, “Your dwelling is secure. Your nest is set in the rock. 
24:22 Yet Kain will be destroyed, when Asshur captures you.” 
24:23 Again he uttered his oracle and said, “O, who can live when God does this? 
24:24 Ships will come from Kittim’s shore. They will afflict Asshur and Eber, but they too will come to destruction.” 
24:25 Then Balaam got up and went and returned to his own place, and Balak went on his way.
25:1 While Israel was staying in Shittim, the people began to have immoral sexual relations with women from Moab. 
25:2 Then they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, so the people were eating, and bowing down before their gods. 
25:3  grew hot against Israel. 
25:4 ’s fierce anger may be turned away from Israel.” 
25:5 So Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Each of you, kill your men who have been joining themselves to Baal of Peor.” 
25:6 , while they were weeping at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting! 
25:7  saw it, he arose from the midst of the assembly, took a spear in his hand, 
25:8  was stopped. 
25:9 However, 24,000 were dead because of the plague!
25:10  spoke to Moses saying, 
25:11  in My zeal.

25:16  spoke to Moses saying, 
25:17 “Deal with the Midianites as enemies and strike them. 
25:18 For they have been enemies to you in their deceptions of you in the matter of Peor and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite prince, their sister who was slain on the day of the plague on account of the Peor incident.”
26:1  saying,

30:5  will forgive her because her father has forbidden her. 
30:6 “Suppose she should marry, after her vow or a rash promise of her lips by which she obligated herself.

30:8  will forgive her. 
30:9 “Any vow or obligation of a widow or a divorced woman will be binding on her.

30:13 Her husband may ratify or veto any vow or sworn oath to deny herself. 
30:14 “But if her husband says nothing to her from day to day, then he is confirming all her vows and all her oaths that are on her. He confirms them by saying nothing to her on the day of his hearing about it. 
30:15 But if he nullifies them after hearing about it, he will bear her guilt.” 
30:16  gave to Moses relevant to relationships between a man and his wife, as well as between a father and his young daughter still living in his house.

31:2 . Afterward you will be gathered to your people.” 
31:3 ’s vengeance on Midian. 
31:4 Send into the battle 1,000 men from each of the tribes of Israel.” 
31:5 So from the thousands of Israel 1,000 from each tribe were assigned, 12,000 in all. 
31:6 , who took with him articles from the Sanctuary and trumpets for signaling. 
31:7  had commanded Moses, and killed every male. 
31:8 Among the slain they also killed the Midianite kings: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword. 
31:9  also captured women and sons of Midian, along with all their herds and flocks, and plundered all their goods. 
31:10 They burned with fire all the Midianite cities, settlements, as well as all their camps.

31:12  at their camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan at Jericho. 
31:13 , and all the princes of the community went to meet them outside the camp. 
31:14 But Moses was angry with the officers of the army—the commanders of thousands, the commanders of hundreds, those returning from the campaign of the war. 
31:15 Moses said to them, “You let all the women live? 
31:16 ! 
31:17 So now, kill all the boys and kill every woman who has been intimate with a man. 
31:18 But save for yourselves every girl who has not been intimate with a man. 
31:19 “Any of you who has killed anyone or touched the body of anyone who has been killed must stay outside the camp for seven days. You must purify yourselves, on the third and seventh days—you and your captives. 
31:20 Also purify every item of clothing as well as every item made of leather or wood.” 
31:21  gave to Moses: 
31:22 The gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead, 
31:23 and anything able to pass through fire is to be put through the fire and will then be clean. It is also to be purified with the water of cleansing. Anything that cannot stand the fire is to be put through the water. 
31:24 You are to wash your clothes also on the seventh day. You will then be clean and may then come into the camp.” 
31:25  said to Moses saying, 
31:26  and the princes of the fathers of the community. 
31:27 You are to divide the spoil between those fighting in the war, taking part in the battle, and the rest of the community. 
31:28 , one item from every 500, whether persons, cattle, donkeys or flock. 
31:29 ’s part. 
31:30 ’s Tabernacle.”

31:34 61,000 donkeys,

31:45 30,500 donkeys, 
31:46 16,000 persons. 
31:47  had commanded Moses. 
31:48 Then the officers over the units of the army, the commanders over thousands and hundreds, came to Moses.

31:53 Each of the men of the army had taken plunder for himself. 
31:54 .
32:1 The sons of Reuben and Gad had very large herds and flocks, and, they saw that the territory of Jazer and Gilead were ideal for livestock. 
32:2 , and the princes of the community saying, 
32:3 “Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon— 
32:4  conquered before the community of Israel—are suitable for livestock, and your servants have livestock.” 
32:5 Then they said, “If we have found favor in your eyes, let this territory be given to your servants as a possession. Don’t make us cross the Jordan.” 
32:6 Moses replied to the sons of Gad and Reuben, “Should your countrymen go to war while you dwell here? 
32:7  has given to them? 
32:8 Your fathers did this when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land. 
32:9  had given them. 
32:10  was aroused that day, and He swore an oath saying: 
32:11 ‘The men who came out of Egypt, from 20 years old and upward, will not see the land I promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, for they have not followed after Me with a whole heart—
32:12 .’ 
32:13 ’s sight was gone. 
32:14 ’s great wrath against Israel! 
32:15 If you turn away from Him, He will repeat again leaving this people in the wilderness, you being the cause of this people’s destruction.” 
32:16 Then they came up to him and said, “We will build sheepfolds for our livestock and cities for our children. 
32:17  until we have brought them to their place. Our children will live in the cities fortified against the inhabitants of the land. 
32:18  has received his inheritance. 
32:19 Yet we will not inherit with them on the side beyond the Jordan, since our inheritance has come on the east side of the Jordan.” 
32:20 , 
32:21  has driven His enemies from before Him 
32:22 . 
32:23 ! Be assured! Your sin will find you out! 
32:24 Build for yourselves cities for your children and pens for your flocks. Then do what has come out of your mouth.” 
32:25 The sons of Gad and Reuben said to Moses saying, “Your servants will do just as my lord is commanding. 
32:26 Our children, our wives, our flocks, and all of our herds will remain here in the cities of Gilead. 
32:27 , just as my lord says.” 
32:28 . 
32:29 , when the land is subdued before you, then give them the territory of Gilead as a possession. 
32:30 However, if they do not cross over fully armed, they are to possess the land of Canaan with you.” 
32:31  has said to your servants, so we will do. 
32:32  into Canaan, but our inheritance will be on this side of the Jordan.” 
32:33 Moses then gave to them—the sons of Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, son of Joseph—the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan—the land with its cities and the territory around the cities. 
32:34 The sons of Gad built up Dibon, Ataroth and Aroer, 
32:35 as well as Atroh-shophan, Jazer and Jogbehah, 
32:36 Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran as fortified cities, as well as sheep pens. 
32:37 The sons of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 
32:38 Nebo, Baal Meon, (cities whose names were changed) and Sibmah. They gave other names to the rebuilt cities. 
32:39 The sons of Machir son of Manasseh went up to Gilead, captured it, and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
32:40 So Moses gave Gilead to Machir son of Manasseh, and he lived there. 
32:41 Jair, a son of Manasseh, went and captured their settlements and named them Jair’s Villages. 
32:42 Nobah went and conquered Kenath and its settlements and named them Nobah after his own name.

33:51  and say to them: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
33:52 You must drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you. You must destroy all their idols and cast images, and demolish their high places. 
33:53 You will take possession of the land, so you will settle in it, because I have given it to you to possess. 
33:54 “You are to divide the land by lot according to your families. To the large, make their inheritance larger, and to the small, make their inheritance smaller. Whatever comes out of the lot will be theirs. You are to distribute the inheritance according to your ancestral tribes. 
33:55 “But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, whoever you allow to remain will become to you barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will give you trouble in the land in which you will be living. 
33:56 Then what I had intended to do to them, I will do to you.”
34:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
34:2  and say to them: When you enter the land of Canaan, these are the boundaries of the land being allotted to you as an inheritance. 
34:3 Your southern side will run from the wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom to the southern end of the Dead Sea on the east. 
34:4 Your border will cross south of the Scorpion Pass and continue to Zin and south of Kadesh-barnea, then go on to Hazar-addar and on to Azmon. 
34:5 Then the border will turn from Azmon to the Wadi of Egypt and end at the sea. 
34:6 “Your western boundary will be the coast of the Great Sea. This will be your western border. 
34:7 “Your northern boundary will be by running a line from the Great Sea to Mount Hor, 
34:8 then from Mount Hor to Levo-Hamath , then the boundary will go to Zedad. 
34:9 The border will continue on to Ziphron, ending at Hazar-Enan. This will be your northern border. 
34:10 “For your eastern border, run a line from Hazar-Enan to Shepham. 
34:11  . 
34:12 From there the border will go down along the Jordan, ending at the Dead Sea. This will be your territory with its surrounding borders.” 
34:13  has commanded that you are to assign by lot to the nine and a half tribes. 
34:14 For the tribe of the sons of Reuben by their ancestral houses, the tribe of the sons of Gad by their ancestral houses, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance. 
34:15 These two and a half tribes have received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan at Jericho, toward the sunrise.” 
34:16  spoke to Moses saying, 
34:17  and Joshua son of Nun. 
34:18 Also you are to select one prince from each tribe to allot the land. 
34:19 These are their names: from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh.

34:26 The prince from the tribe of the sons of Issachar is Paltiel son of Azzan. 
34:27 The prince from the tribe of the sons of Asher is Ahihud son of Shelomi.

34:29  the land of Canaan.
35:1  spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho saying, 
35:2  to give to the Levites from the inheritance of their possessions cities in which to live. They are also to give the Levites pasturelands around the cities. 
35:3 Thus they will have cities to live in and pastures for their cattle, flocks and all their livestock. 
35:4 The pastures you give the Levites will extend out from the walls around the cities for 1,000 cubits. 
35:5 You are to measure outside the cities 2,000 cubits on the east side, 2,000 cubits on the south side, on the west side 2,000 cubits, and on the north side 2,000 cubits. These are to be pasturelands for the cities. 
35:6 “Six of the cities you give the Levites are to be cities of refuge, to which anyone who kills anyone may flee. Besides these, you are to give the Levites 42 more cities. 
35:7 In all, you are to give the Levites 48 cities with their pastures. 
35:8  should be proportionate to the inheritance of each tribe—give many from the one who has many and few from the one who has few.” 
35:9  spoke to Moses saying, 
35:10  saying: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
35:11 You are to select cities which will be cities of refuge, to which one might flee if he has killed someone by accident. 
35:12 They are to be cities for refuge from the avenger, so the manslayer may not die before standing trial before the assembly. 
35:13 The six cities you designate are to be your cities of refuge. 
35:14 Designate three cities on this side of the Jordan and three in the land of Canaan as cities of refuge. 
35:15  as well as for the outsider and the visitor in their midst, for anyone killing a person by accident. 
35:16 Now if the manslayer strikes someone with an iron object so that he dies, he is a murderer and the murderer must die. 
35:17 If anyone has a stone in his hand that could be deadly and strikes anyone with it so that he dies, he is a murderer and the murderer must die. 
35:18 Or if someone has a wooden object that could kill and strikes anyone so that he dies, he is a murderer and the murderer must be put to death. 
35:19 The blood avenger himself may put the murderer to death. When he finds him, he is to kill him. 
35:20 “If anyone pushes someone maliciously, or throws anything at him with deadly intent, 
35:21 or with hostility hits him with his fist so that he dies, the one hitting him is a murderer. The blood avenger may put the murderer to death when he finds him. 
35:22 But if he pushes him suddenly or throws an object at him with no intent, 
35:23 or without seeing him should drop a stone on him resulting in his death, but he was not his enemy and intended him no harm, 
35:24 the assembly must judge between the manslayer and the avenger of blood according to these regulations. 
35:25  who was anointed with the holy oil. 
35:26 “But if the manslayer should go outside the city limit of his city of refuge to which he had fled, 
35:27 and should the blood avenger find him outside the city limits of the refuge city, the blood avenger may put him to death without being guilty of his blood. 
35:28  , the manslayer may return to his property. 
35:29 “These are to be statutes of justice for your generations in all your dwelling places. 
35:30 Everyone killing anyone shall be put to death as a murderer only on the testimony of more than one witness. No one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness. 
35:31 “You are not to accept ransom for the life of a murderer. He deserves to die and he is to die. 
35:32  ’s death. 
35:33 You are not to pollute the land in which you are. Blood pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made for land polluted by bloodshed except by the blood of the one who sheds it. 
35:34 .”
36:1 . 
36:2  to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters. 
36:3 “If they become wives of men from other tribes of Israel, their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry. So it will be deducted from the allotment of our inheritance. 
36:4 When the Jubilee year comes, their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry and deducted from the inheritance of our ancestral tribe.” 
36:5 , “What the tribe of the descendants of Joseph is saying is correct. 
36:6  commands for the daughters of Zelophehad saying: They may become wives to whomever they please, as long as they marry within the family of the tribe of their father. 
36:7  will each keep the inheritance of the tribe of his ancestors. 
36:8  will each possess the inheritance of his fathers. 
36:9  is to keep its inheritance.” 
36:10  commanded Moses. 
36:11 Zelophehad’s daughters—Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noah—married sons of their uncles. 
36:12 They married within the families of the sons of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained within the tribe of their ancestral family. 
36:13 , on the plains of Moab at Jericho along the Jordan.
