1:1 The words of Amos, who was among the shepherds from Tekoa. He perceived these words concerning Israel during the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and during the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. 
1:2 He said: </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:3 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:4 I will send fire into Hazael’s palace. It will devour Ben-hadad’s citadels. 
1:5 I will break the Damascus gate-bar and cut off the inhabitant from the Valley of Aven, wielding Beth-eden’s scepter. So the people of Aram will go into exile to Kir. </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:6 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:7 So I will send fire on the wall of Gaza —it will devour its citadels. 
1:8 I will cut off Ashdod’s inhabitant, wielding Ashkelon’s scepter. I will turn My hand against Ekron and the rest of the Philistines will perish. My Lord </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:9 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:10 I will send fire on the wall of Tyre— it will devour its citadels.

1:12 So I will send fire in Teman— it will devour Bozrah’s citadels. 
1:13 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:14 I will kindle fire on Rabbah’s wall and it will devour its citadels, amid shouting on a day of battle, with storm on a day of whirlwind. 
1:15 Their king will go into exile, he and his princes together. Thus </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:1 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:2 So I will send fire upon Moab— it will devour Kerioth’s citadels. Moab will die in an uproar, with a shout of alarm and the sound of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shofar
2:3 I will cut off the ruler from her midst, and slay all her princes with him. Thus </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

2:5 So I will send fire upon Judah— it will devour Jerusalem’s citadels.” 
2:6 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:7 They trample the head of the poor into the dust of the earth and thwart the way of the humble. A man and his father go to the same girl, to profane My holy Name. 
2:8 Upon garments taken in pledge they stretch out beside every altar, and drink wine confiscated as fines in the house of their gods. 
2:9 “I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like cedars and as strong as oaks— yes, I destroyed his fruit from above and his roots from beneath. 
2:10  It was I also who brought you up from the land of Egypt and led you forty years in the wilderness to possess the Amorite’s land. 
2:11 I raised up prophets from your sons and Nazirites from your young men. Is this not so, Bnei Yisrael?” declares </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:12 “But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and you commanded the prophets saying, ‘Do not prophesy.’ 
2:13 Behold! I will cause a tottering beneath you as a cart totters when full of sheaves. 
2:14 Then flight will fail for the swift. The mighty will not strengthen his power, The warrior will not save his life. 
2:15 The archer will not stand, the fleet-footed will not escape, the horseman will not save himself. 
2:16 The valiant among the warriors will flee naked in that day.” declares </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

3:9 Proclaim on the citadels in Ashdod and the citadels in the land of Egypt: “Assemble on Samaria’s mountains: Behold the great tumult within it, even the oppression within it.” 
3:10 They do not know how to be honest, —declares </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:11 Therefore thus says my Lord </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

3:14 “For in a day I shall punish Israel for the transgressions of Israel, and attend to the altars of Bethel— the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground. 
3:15 I will also strike the winter house together with the summer house. The houses of ivory will perish, and great houses will be demolished.” It is the declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:1 Hear this word, you cows of Bashan, who are on Samaria’s hill, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who say to their masters: “Bring, so we may drink.” 
4:2 My Lord </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:3 You will go out through breaches— each woman straight ahead, and you will be cast to Harmon.” It is the declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:4 “Come to Bethel and transgress, in Gilgal multiply transgression. Every morning bring your sacrifices and your tithes every three days.

4:7 “Also I myself have withheld from you the rain—when three months remain to the harvest, I caused it to rain on one city, while on another city I sent no rain; one piece of ground would get rain, while the portion not rained on would wither. 
4:8 So two or three cities go staggering to one city to drink water, but would not be satisfied— yet you have not returned to Me,” declares </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:9 “I struck you with blight and mildew. Your many gardens and vineyards, your fig-trees and olive trees the locust has devoured— yet you have not returned to Me,” declares </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:10 “I sent among you a plague in the manner of Egypt. I slew your young men by the sword, with your chariot-horses in captivity.

4:11 I overthrew some of you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You became like a firebrand snatched from a blaze— yet you have not returned to Me,” declares </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:12 “Therefore here is what I will do to you, Israel. Because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, Israel!”

5:1 Hear this word that I take up as a lament over you, O house of Israel: 
5:2 She has fallen, never rising again— virgin Israel— She is forsaken on her land, with nobody to lift her up. 
5:3 For thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:4 For thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:5 But do not seek Bethel, do not go to Gilgal, do not cross over to Beersheba. For Gilgal will surely go into exile, and Bethel will come to trouble. 
5:6 Seek </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:7 You who turn justice to wormwood threw righteousness to the ground. 
5:8 He who made the Pleiades and Orion and changes deep darkness to morning. Who darkens the day into night. Who summons the water of the sea and pours it out on the face of the earth —</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:9 He flashes destruction on the mighty, so destruction will come against a fortress. 
5:10 They despise one who reproves at the gate, so they detest one who speaks with integrity. 
5:11 Therefore, because you trample on the poor, exacting from him a burden of grain, you built houses of hewn stone, but will not dwell in them, you planted pleasant vineyards, but will not drink their wine. 
5:12 For I know your crimes are many and your sins countless— afflicting the righteous, taking bribes, and turning the needy aside at the gate. 
5:13 Therefore the prudent keep silent at such a time —for it is a distressful time. 
5:14 Seek good and not evil, so you may live, and so </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:15 Hate evil, love good, maintain justice at the gate. Maybe </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

5:17 In all vineyards will be wailing, for I will pass through your midst” —</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:18  will be darkness and not light. 
5:19 It will be as when a man is fleeing from a lion—and meets a bear! Or he comes home, leans his hand on the wall, and a snake bites him!

5:21 “I hate, I despise your festivals! I take no delight in your sacred assemblies. 
5:22 Even if you offer me burnt offerings and your grain offerings, I will not accept them, nor will I look at peace offerings of your fattened animals. 
5:23 Take away from Me the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the melody of your harps. 
5:24 But let justice roll like water and righteousness like an ever-flowing torrent. 
5:25 Did you bring sacrifices and offerings to Me in the wilderness for forty years, O house of Israel? 
5:26 But you lifted up your images —Siccuth your ‘king’, and Chiun, your star gods— which you made for yourselves, 
5:27 So I will send you into exile, beyond Damascus.” </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:1  ! You who are at ease in Zion, trusting in Samaria’s hill! Distinguished ones of the foremost of nations— to whom the house of Israel comes 
6:2 Go over to Calneh and look. From there go to great Hamath, go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are you better than these kingdoms? Or is their territory larger than yours? 
6:3 Dismissing the day of calamity, you bring near the throne of violence. 
6:4 Reclining on beds of ivory, sprawling on their couches, dining on lambs from the flock and calves from amid the stall, 
6:5 chanting to the sound of harp like David, inventing their own instruments of song, 
6:6 drinking wine from bowls, anointing with choice ointments— yet they are not sickened over the breakdown of Joseph. 
6:7 Therefore now they will go into exile at the head of the exiles. Sprawling revelry will cease. 
6:8 My Lord </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:9 If ten people remain in one house, they will die. 
6:10 One’s beloved—the one burning incense for him—will lift him up to carry the bones out of the house, and he will say to one in the innermost recess of the house: “Is anyone else still with you?” And he will say: “No one.” Then he will say, “Hush! For we must not mention the Name of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:11 For behold, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:12 Will horses run on the cliff? Will one plow there with oxen? Yet you turned justice into venom, the fruit of righteousness into wormwood. 
6:13 You are rejoicing for no reason, saying: “Haven’t we taken two horns for ourselves by our own strength?” 
6:14 “For behold, I am raising up against you, O house of Israel, a nation, and they will afflict you from Lebo-Hamath to the Valley of the Arabah.” declares </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

7:6 . 
7:7 This is what He has revealed to me: Behold, my Lord was standing by a vertical wall, and in His hand was a plumb line. 
7:8 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:9 So the high places of Isaac will become desolate, the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste, and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.” 
7:10 Then Amaziah, the priest of Beth-el, sent word to King Jeroboam of Israel, saying: “Amos has been conspiring against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land cannot endure all his words. 
7:11 For this is what Amos has said: ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go captive from his land.’” 
7:12 Then Amaziah said to Amos: “Seer, go away! Flee back to the land of Judah. Eat bread there, and prophesy there. 
7:13 But at Bethel you are not to prophesy any more—for it is a royal sanctuary and a house of the kingdom.” 
7:14 So Amos responded and said to Amaziah: “I am no prophet, nor am I a son of a prophet. Rather, I am a shepherd tending fig trees. 
7:15 But </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:16 So now, hear the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

8:1 This is what my Lord </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:2 He said: “Amos, what do you see?” “A basket of summer fruit,” I said. Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:3 The songs of the palace will become howls in that day.” It is a declaration of my Lord </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:4 Hear this, you who trample the poor, destroying the afflicted of the land 
8:5 saying: ‘When will the New Moon be over, so we may sell grain? Or Shabbat, so we may open the wheat market? —Let’s reduce the ephah measure and increase the shekel, cheat with deceitful balances, 
8:6 buy the poor for silver, the needy for a pair of sandals! We’ll even sell the refuse of the grain!’” 
8:7  swore by the Pride of Jacob: “Never will I forget all their deeds! 
8:8 Will not the land tremble over this? Will not all who dwell in it mourn? Yes, it will rise up like all the Nile —it will surge and sink again like the Nile of Egypt.” 
8:9 “It will be in that day” —declares my Lord </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:10 I will turn your festivals into mourning and all your songs into a dirge. I will pull up sackcloth on every waist and baldness on every head. I will make it like the mourning for an only son— its end a bitter day.” 
8:11 “Behold, days are coming” —declares my Lord </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:12 So people will wander from sea to sea and roam from north to east, searching for the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:13 In that day, the fair virgins and the virile young men will faint from thirst. 
8:14 Those swearing by Samaria’s guilt will say, ‘As your gods live, Dan!’ or ‘As the way of Beersheba lives!’ But they will fall, never to rise again.”
9:1 I saw my Lord standing by the altar, and He said: “Strike the tops of the pillars, so the porches shake! Break all of them off at the head! Then the last of them I will slay with the sword— none of them fleeing will escape and no fugitive will slip away. 
9:2 If they should dig down to </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Sheol
9:3 If they should hide themselves at the top of Carmel, I will search them out and take them from there. If they hide themselves from My eyes at the bottom of the sea, from there I will command the sea serpent to bite them. 
9:4 If they should go into captivity before their enemies, from there I will command the sword to slay them. I will set My eyes upon them for calamity and not for prosperity.” 
9:5 My Lord is </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
9:6 He who builds His upper stories in heaven fitted its vault over the earth. He who summons the waters of the sea and pours them out on the face of the earth —</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

9:11 “In that day I will raise up David’s fallen </span><span class="it"><span class="content">sukkah

9:14 Yes, I will restore the captivity of My people Israel. They will rebuild desolated cities and dwell in them. They will plant vineyards and drink their wine. They will also make gardens and eat their fruit.
