1:1 An oracle: The word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:2 “I loved you,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:3 and Esau I hated. I made his hills a wasteland and gave his inheritance to jackals of the wilderness.” 
1:4 For Edom may say, “We have been beaten down, but we will return and rebuild the ruins.” Thus </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:5 So you will see, and you will say: ‘May </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:6 “A son honors his father, and a servant his master. So if I am Father, where is My honor? If I am Master, where is My reverence?”—says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:7 “By offering defiled bread on My altar.” But you say, “How did we defile You?” When you say, “The table of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:8 “When you bring a blind one as sacrifice, is it not wrong? Or when you bring a lame or sick one, is it not wrong? Offer them now to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Or will he acknowledge you favorably?” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:9 “So now, implore God’s favor! Then, will He be gracious to us? Since this has come from your hands, will He accept any of it from you?” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:10 “If just one of you would shut the doors, and not light My altar uselessly! I have no delight in you,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:11 “For from sunrise to its setting My Name will be great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to My Name with a pure grain offering, for My Name will be great among the nations,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:12 But you are profaning it when you say, “The table of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:13 You also say, “It’s so tedious!” “And you sniff at it,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:14 “Moreover, cursed is a deceiver who has in his flock a male, but makes a vow and sacrifices something blemished to my Lord. For I am a great King,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:1 “So now, </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
2:2 If you will not listen, and if you will not take to heart to give glory to My Name” —says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:3 Behold, I am rebuking the seed on account of you, and will spread dung on your faces —the dung of your festivals— and take you away together with it. 
2:4 Then you will know that I have sent this command to you, to be My covenant with Levi,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:5 “My covenant was with him for life and </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom
2:6 Instruction of truth was in his mouth. Injustice was not found on his lips. In </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom
2:7 For a </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
2:8 But you have turned from the way. You caused many to stumble in </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
2:9 “So I also have made you despised and lowly to all the people, because you are not keeping My ways but show favoritism in </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
2:10 Do we not all have one Father? Has not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously —a man against his brother— defiling the covenant of our fathers? 
2:11 Judah has dealt treacherously, an abomination done in Israel, even in Jerusalem! For Judah has defiled </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:12 .
2:13 Secondly, you do this: Tears cover the altar of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:14 Yet you say, “Why?” Because </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:15 Did the One not make her with a remnant of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
2:16 “For I hate divorce,” —says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:17 You wearied </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:1 “Behold, I am sending My messenger, and he will clear the way before Me. Suddenly He will come to His Temple —the Lord whom you seek— and the Messenger of the covenant —the One whom you desire— behold, He is coming,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:2 But who can endure the day of His coming? Or who can stand when He appears? For He will be like a refiner’s fire, and like soap for cleaning raw wool. 
3:3 And He will sit as a smelter or a purifier of silver, and He will cleanse the sons of Levi, and purify them like gold or silver. Then they will become for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:4 Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:5 “Then I will draw near to you in judgment, and I will be a swift witness against sorcerers, adulterers, perjurers those who extort a worker’s wage, or oppress the widow or an orphan, those who mislead a stranger. They do not fear Me,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:6 “For I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:7 “From the days of your ancestors you have turned aside from My statutes, and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:8 “Will a man rob God? For you are robbing Me!” But you say: “How have we robbed You?” “In the tithe and the offering. 
3:9 You have been cursed with the curse, yet you keep robbing Me—the whole nation! 
3:10 Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse. Then there will be food in My House. Now test Me in this”—says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:11 I will rebuke the devouring pest for you, so it will not destroy the fruit of your land, nor will your vine be barren in the field,” </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:12 “All the nations will call you blessed. For you will be a land of delight,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:13 “Your words against Me are grievous,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:14 You say: “Serving God is worthless.” Also: “What good is it that we kept His service or that we walked as mourners before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:15 So now we are calling the proud blessed. Those who practice iniquity are built up. Indeed, they have tested God, and escaped!” 
3:16 Then those who revere </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:17 “So they shall be Mine,”—says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:18 Then you will return and distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him.”
