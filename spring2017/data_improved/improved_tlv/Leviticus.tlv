8:12 He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him to consecrate him. 
8:13 Then Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with tunics, tied sashes on them, and fastened headbands on them, as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:14 Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering. 
8:15 Moses then slaughtered it, took the blood and dabbed it onto the horns of the altar with his finger, and so purified the altar. Then he poured out the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it, to make atonement for it. 
8:16 He then took all the fat that was on the innards, the cover of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and burned it up as smoke on the altar. 
8:17 But the bull and its hide, its flesh and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:18 He then presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.

8:20 After he cut the ram into its pieces, Moses burned the head, the pieces, and the fat. 
8:21 He washed the innards and the legs with water. Then Moses burned the whole ram up in smoke on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:22 Then he presented the second ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 
8:23 Moses slaughtered it, took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot. 
8:24 Then Moses brought Aaron’s sons and put some of the blood on the tips of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the great toes of their right feet. Then Moses splashed the blood around on the altar. 
8:25 He took the fat, the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the innards, as well as the cover of the liver, the two kidneys with their fat and the right thigh. 
8:26 Then out of the basket of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">matzah

8:29 Moses took the breast and waved it for a wave offering before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:30 Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons’ garments with him. So he consecrated Aaron, his garments, his sons and his sons’ garments with him. 
8:31 Moses then said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the meat at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and eat it there, along with the bread that is in the basket of ordination, as I commanded, saying: ‘Aaron and his sons are to eat it.’ 
8:32 What remains of the meat and of the bread you should burn with fire. 
8:33 You are not to go out from the entrance of the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are fulfilled, for he will be filling your hands for seven days.

9:8 So Aaron drew near to the altar, and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. 
9:9 The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him. Then he dipped his finger in the blood, dabbed it onto the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar.

9:13 They handed the burnt offering to him piece by piece, along with the head, and he burned them up as smoke on the altar. 
9:14 He washed the innards and the legs and he offered them in smoke upon the burnt offering on the altar. 
9:15 Then he presented the people’s gift, took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, slaughtered it, and offered it for sin, just like the first one. 
9:16 He presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the decree. 
9:17 Then Aaron presented the grain offering, filling his hand with some of it and burning it up as smoke on the altar, alongside the burnt offering of the morning. 
9:18 He also slaughtered the bull and the ram as the sacrifice of fellowship offerings for the people. Then his sons brought him the blood, which he splashed around on the altar, 
9:19 as well as the fat from the bull and the ram, the fat tail, and the layer over the innards along with the kidneys and the covering of the liver. 
9:20 They put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned it on the altar. 
9:21 But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
9:22 Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them. Then he stepped down from presenting the sin offering, the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings. 
9:23 Moses and Aaron then went into the Tent of Meeting. When they came back out and blessed the people, the glory of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
9:24 Fire came out from the presence of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:1 Now Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu each took his own censer, put fire in it, laid incense over it, and offered unauthorized fire before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:2 So fire came out from the presence of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:3 Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:4 Then Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come near, carry your relatives away from the front of the Sanctuary to outside of the camp.” 
10:5 So they drew near and carried them, still in their tunics, outside of the camp, as Moses had said. 
10:6 Then Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons: “Do not uncover your heads or tear your clothes, so you may not die and He will not be angry with the entire congregation. But let your kinsmen—the whole house of Israel—mourn over the burning that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:7 You must not go out from the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, or you will die, for the anointing oil of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:8  spoke to Aaron saying: 
10:9 “Do not drink wine or fermented drink, neither you nor your sons with you, when you go into the Tent of Meeting, so that you do not die. This is to be a statute forever throughout your generations. 
10:10 You are to make a distinction between the holy and the common and between the unclean and the clean. 
10:11 And you are to teach </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
10:12 Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Itamar his surviving sons: “Take the grain ­offering left over from </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:13 You are to eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion and your sons’ portion of the offerings of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:14 You are to eat the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented in a clean place—you, your sons and your daughters with you—for they are given as your portion, and your children’s portion, out of the sacrifices of the fellowship offerings of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
10:15 They are to bring the thigh that is presented and the breast that is waved with fat portions scorched by fire, to wave it as a wave offering before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:16 Then Moses searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering and noticed it had been burned up. So he snapped at Eleazar and Itamar, the surviving sons of Aaron, saying: 
10:17 “Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the Sanctuary, since it is most holy, and He gave it to you in order to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:18 Look, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly shall have eaten it in the Sanctuary, as I commanded.” 
10:19 But Aaron said to Moses, “Behold, today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:20 When Moses heard this, it was good in his eyes.
11:1  spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them, 
11:2 “Speak to </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
11:3 Whatever has a split, divided hoof and chews cud among the animals—that you may eat. 
11:4 “Nevertheless, you should not eat of those that only chew cud, or have a split hoof. The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof, is unclean to you. 
11:5 The coney, though it chews the cud yet does not have a divided hoof, so it is unclean to you. 
11:6 The hare, though it chews the cud, does not split the hoof, so it is unclean to you. 
11:7 The pig, though it has a split, divided hoof, does not chew cud, so it is unclean to you. 
11:8 You are not to eat meat from them, nor are you to touch their carcasses. They are unclean to you. 
11:9 “From all that are in the waters, you may eat whatever has fins and scales, within the waters, in the seas and in the rivers. Those you may eat. 
11:10 But any that do not have fins and scales in the seas or the rivers, among those that swarm on the waters, or among any of the living creatures that are in the waters, they are loathsome to you. 
11:11 They are to be detestable to you. You should not eat meat from them and you should detest their carcasses. 
11:12 Whatever has neither fins nor scales in the waters, that is a detestable thing to you. 
11:13 “Among the birds you should detest the following—they are not to be eaten—they are loathsome: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture, 
11:14 the red kite, any kind of black kite, 
11:15 any kind of raven, 
11:16 the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk, 
11:17 the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl, 
11:18 the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey, 
11:19 the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat. 
11:20 “All flying insects that walk on all fours are detestable to you. 
11:21 Yet you may eat from all winged creeping things that go on all fours, which have legs above their feet, with which to hop on the earth. 
11:22 You may eat from any kind of locust, any kind of katydid, any kind of cricket and any kind of grasshopper. 
11:23 But all winged creeping things that have four feet are loathsome to you. 
11:24 “Moreover, by these also you will become unclean: whoever touches their carcasses should be unclean until the evening. 
11:25 Whoever carries any part of their carcass is to wash his clothes, and will be unclean until the evening. 
11:26 “Every animal with a separating hoof but not split, or does not chew cud, is unclean to you. Everyone who touches them will become unclean. 
11:27 So whatever moves on its paws, among all animals that go on all fours, is unclean to you. Whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean until the evening. 
11:28 Whoever carries their carcasses, is to wash his clothes and will be unclean until the evening. They are unclean to you. 
11:29 “Among the creeping things that creep on the earth, the following are unclean to you: the weasel, the rat, any kind of great lizard, 
11:30 the gecko, the monitor lizard, the wall lizard, the skink and the chameleon. 
11:31 Among all that creep these are the ones that are unclean to you. Whoever touches them when they are dead, will be unclean until the evening. 
11:32 Whatever falls on them when they are dead will become unclean, whether it is any vessel of wood, or clothing, or skin, or sackcloth. Whatever vessel it is, with which any work is done, it must be put into water, and it will be unclean until the evening, then it will be clean. 
11:33 “Now if any of them falls into a clay pot, everything that is in it will become unclean, and you are to break it. 
11:34 Any food that may be eaten but has water on it from such a pot will become unclean. Also any drink that may be drunk in any such pot will become unclean. 
11:35 Everything on which part of their carcass falls will become unclean. An oven or stove for pots is to be broken in pieces. They are unclean and will be unclean to you. 
11:36 Nevertheless, a spring or a cistern for collecting water will be clean, though anyone who touches their carcass will become unclean. 
11:37 If part of a carcass falls on any seed for sowing that has yet to be sown, it is clean. 
11:38 But if water is put on the seed, and part of a carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you. 
11:39 “If any animal that you may eat dies, the one who touches its carcass will become unclean until the evening. 
11:40 He who eats of its carcass is to wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. Also, the one who carries its carcass is to wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. 
11:41 “Every creeping thing that crawls on the earth is detestable—it shall not be eaten. 
11:42 Whatever moves on its belly or crawls on all fours or has many feet among all the creeping things that crawl on the earth, these you are not to eat, for they are detestable. 
11:43 You are not to contaminate yourselves with any creeping thing that crawls nor make yourselves unclean with them or defiled by them.

16:4 He is to put on the holy linen garment, have the linen undergarments on his body, put on the linen sash, and wear the linen turban—they are the holy garments. He shall bathe his body in water, and put them on.

25:6 Whatever the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Shabbat

25:9 Then on the tenth day of the seventh month, on </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Yom Kippur
25:10 You are to make the fiftieth year holy, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It is to be a Jubilee to you, when each of you is to return to his own property and each of you is to return to his family. 
25:11 That fiftieth year will be your Jubilee. You are not to sow, or reap that which grows by itself, or gather from the untended vines. 
25:12 Since it is a Jubilee, it is to be holy to you. You will eat from its increase out of the field. 
25:13 “In this Year of Jubilee each of you will return to his property. 
25:14 “If you sell anything to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, you are not to wrong one another. 
25:15 Corresponding to the number of years after the Jubilee you are to purchase land from your neighbor’s hand. He is to sell it to you based on the number of years of crops. 
25:16 In proportion to the extent of years you may increase its price, or decrease its price in proportion to the fewness of years, because he is selling a number of harvests to you. 
25:17 You are not to cheat one another, but fear your God, for I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:18 “Therefore you are to keep My statutes and observe My ordinances, and carry them out, so that you may live securely in the land. 
25:19 Then the land will yield its fruit, and you may eat your fill and live there in safety. 
25:20 Now if you ask: What are we to eat during the seventh year if, see, we are not to sow, nor gather in our increase? 
25:21 Now I will command My blessing to you in the sixth year, so that it will yield a harvest sufficient for three years. 
25:22 When you sow during the eighth year, you will still be eating the old, stored harvest until the harvest of the ninth year comes in. 
25:23 “Moreover, the land is not to be sold ­permanently, because the land is Mine. For you are sojourners with Me. 
25:24 For any land you possess, you are to provide for redemption of the land. 
25:25 “If your brother becomes poor and sells some of his property, then his nearest kinsman may come and redeem what his brother has sold. 
25:26 If a man has no kinsman-redeemer, but he himself recovers and finds sufficient means to redeem it, 
25:27 then let him reckon the years since its sale and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it. Then he will return to his property. 
25:28 But if he is not able to get it back for himself, then what he has sold is to remain in the hand of the one who has bought it until the Year of Jubilee. Then in the Jubilee it shall be released, so he may return to his property. 
25:29 “If a man sells a house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it has been sold. For a full year he has the right of redemption. 
25:30 But if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city will belong permanently to the one who bought it throughout his generations. It will not be released in the Jubilee. 
25:31 But the houses of the villages that have no wall around them are to be considered as open country. They have redemption rights and are to be released in the Jubilee. 
25:32 “But as for the towns of the Levites, the Levites may have a permanent right of redemption for the houses in the towns of their possession. 
25:33 The Levites may redeem a house sold in the town of its possession. Also it shall be released in the Jubilee, for the houses of the Levitical towns are their possession among </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
25:34 But the fields in the pasturelands of their cities may not be sold, for it is their permanent possession. 
25:35 “If your brother has become poor and his hand cannot support himself among you, then you are to uphold him. He may live with you like an outsider or a temporary resident. 
25:36 Take no excessive interest from him, but fear your God, so that your brother can live with you. 
25:37 You are not to lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit. 
25:38 I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:39 “If your brother has grown poor among you and sells himself to you, you must not subject him to slave labor. 
25:40 Let him stay with you as a hired worker or as a temporary resident. He will work for you until the Year of Jubilee, 
25:41 then he is to be released from you—he and his children with him—and may return to his own family and to the property of his fathers. 
25:42 For they are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. They are not to be sold in a slave sale. 
25:43 You are not to rule over him with harshness, but fear your God. 
25:44 “As for your male and female slaves whom you may acquire out of the nations that are around you—from them you may buy male and female slaves. 
25:45 You may also acquire from among the children of the foreigners dwelling among you, as well as from their families who are with you—those born in your land—they may also become your property. 
25:46 You may also leave them an inheritance for your children after you, to receive as a possession. These may become your slaves permanently. But over your brothers, </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
25:47 “If an outsider or sojourner with you becomes rich, while your brother beside him has become poor and sells himself to the outsider dwelling among you or to a member of the outsider’s family, 
25:48 after he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him, 
25:49 or his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him, or anyone who is a close relative to him from his family may also redeem him. Or if he has grown rich, he may redeem himself. 
25:50 He is to calculate with the one who bought him, from the year that he sold himself to the Year of Jubilee, and the price of his sale will be in proportion to the number of years. Like the days of a hired worker it will be with him. 
25:51 If there are still many years, in proportion to those he is to reimburse the price of his redemption from his purchase price. 
25:52 If there remain only a few years until the Year of Jubilee, then he shall calculate with him in proportion to his years of service he is to reimburse the price of his redemption. 
25:53 He will stay with him as a hired worker, year by year. But he is not to rule with harshness over him in your sight. 
25:54 Even if he is not redeemed by these means, then he will still be released in the Year of Jubilee—he and his children with him.

26:16 then I will do the following to you in return. I will appoint terror over you, wasting disease and fever that will dim the eyes and cause the soul to pine away. You will sow your seed in vain, because your enemies will eat it. 
26:17 I will set My face against you and you will be routed before your enemies. Those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when no one pursues you. 
26:18 “If you, in spite of these things, will not listen to Me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins. 
26:19 I will break your pride of power. I will make your sky like iron and your earth like bronze. 
26:20 Also your strength will be spent in vain, for your land will not yield its increase, nor will the trees of the land yield their fruit. 
26:21 “If you keep walking contrary to Me and will not listen to Me, then I will multiply the plagues on you seven times like your sins. 
26:22 I will send the wild animals among you, which will rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and make you so few in number that your roads will become deserted. 
26:23 “Now if in spite of these things you will not be chastened by Me, but walk contrary to Me instead, 
26:24 then I will also walk contrary to you. Then I will strike you, I Myself, seven times for your sins. 
26:25 I will bring a sword upon you that will execute the vengeance of the covenant, and you will be gathered together inside your cities. I will send the pestilence among you and you will be given into the hand of the enemy. 
26:26 When I break your staff of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven, and they will bring back your bread by weight, so that you will eat but not be satisfied. 
26:27 “Yet if in spite of this you will not listen to Me but walk contrary to Me,

26:29 You will eat the flesh of your sons and you will eat the flesh of your daughters. 
26:30 I will destroy your high places and cut down your altars of incense, cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols, and My soul will abhor you. 
26:31 I will lay waste your cities and devastate your sanctuaries. I will not smell your soothing aromas. 
26:32 I will make the land desolate and your enemies settling there will be astonished at it. 
26:33 I will scatter you among the nations and I will draw out the sword after you. So your land will become a desolation and your cities will become a waste.

26:37 They will stumble over one another, as if before the sword, when no one pursues, and you will have no strength to stand before your enemies. 
26:38 You will perish among the nations and the land of your enemies will devour you. 
26:39 Those of you who are left in the land of your enemies will rot away because of their iniquity, and because of the iniquities of their fathers they will rot away with them.
