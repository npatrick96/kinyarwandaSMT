1:1 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim—his name was Elkanah son of Jeroham son of Elihu son of Tohu son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
1:2 He had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah was childless. 
1:3 Now this man used to go up from his town every year to worship and to sacrifice to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:4 Then on the designated day Elkanah would sacrifice and give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters, 
1:5 but to Hannah he would give only one portion—even though he loved Hannah—for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:6 Her rival would taunt her bitterly to provoke her, because </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:7 So it was year after year, whenever she went up to the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:8 Then her husband Elkanah would say to her, “Hannah, why are you crying? Why won’t you eat? Why is your heart so sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?” 
1:9 After eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah got up. Now Eli the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
1:10 While her soul was bitter, she prayed to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:11 So she made a vow and said, “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:12 It came to pass, as she prayed long before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:13 Now Hannah was praying in her heart—only her lips were moving, but her voice could not be heard. So Eli thought she was drunk. 
1:14 Then Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Get rid of your wine!” 
1:15 But in response Hannah said, “No, my lord, I am a woman with an oppressed spirit! I haven’t been drinking wine or beer. Instead I’ve been pouring out my soul before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:16 Don’t consider your handmaid a wicked woman. For out of my great anguish and grief I’ve been praying until now.” 
1:17 Then Eli responded, “Go in </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom
1:18 “May your maidservant find favor in your eyes,” she said. So the woman went her way; she ate, and her countenance was no longer dejected. 
1:19 They rose up early in the morning and worshipped before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:20 So it came to pass at the turn of the year that Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She called his name Samuel, “because I have asked </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:21 When the man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer the annual sacrifice to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:22 Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “When the child is weaned, I will bring him, so he may appear before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:23 So her husband Elkanah said to her, “Do what seems best to you. Stay until you have weaned him—only may </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:24 When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with three bulls, one ephah of flour and a jar of wine, and brought him to the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:25 After they slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli. 
1:26 “It’s me, my lord!” she said. “As your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman that stood by you here, praying to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:27 For this boy I prayed, and </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:28 So I in turn dedicate him to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:1 Then Hannah prayed and said, “My heart exults in </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:2 There is none holy as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:3 Boast no more so proudly— insolence comes out of your mouth. For </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:4 The bows of the mighty are broken, but the stumbling are girded with strength. 
2:5 Those full hire themselves for bread, but those starving hunger no more. Even the barren gives birth to seven, but she with many sons languishes. 
2:6  and raises up. 
2:7  makes poor and makes rich, He brings low and also lifts up. 
2:8 He raises the helpless from the dust. He lifts the needy from the dunghill, to make them sit with nobles, granting them a seat of honor. For the earth’s pillars are </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:9 He guards the steps of His godly ones, but the wicked are silenced in darkness. For one does not prevail by might. 
2:10 Those who oppose </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:11 Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, while the boy served </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:12 Now Eli’s sons were worthless men; they did not acknowledge </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:13 Now this was the custom of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
2:14 and he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron or pot. Whatever the fork brought up, the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
2:15 Even before they burned the fat, the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
2:16 If the man said to him, “Let them first burn the fat up as smoke, and then take as much as you desire,” he would reply, “No! But you must give it now—otherwise, I will take it by force.” 
2:17 Thus the sin of the young men was very great before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:18 But Samuel was ministering before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:19 Moreover, his mother would make him a little robe and bring it to him from year to year when she would come up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.
2:20 Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, “May </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:21 So </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:22 Now Eli had grown very old. He heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how they slept with the women who served at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting. 
2:23 So he said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear evil reports from all these people concerning you. 
2:24 No, my sons! For this is not a good report that I hear </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:25 If a man sins against another, God may pardon him; but if a man sins against </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:26 Meanwhile, the child Samuel kept growing and increasing in favor both with </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:27 Now there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, “Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:28 Also did I not choose them from all the tribes of Israel to be My </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
2:29 Why do you kick at My sacrifice and My offering which I have commanded in My dwelling, and honor your sons above Me, by fattening yourselves with the choicest of every offering of Israel My people? 
2:30 Therefore </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:31 Behold, the days are coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father’s house, so that no one in your household will reach old age. 
2:32 Moreover, you will behold the distress of My dwelling, despite all that is good that has been done to Israel. So no one in your household will reach old age, forever. 
2:33 Any man of yours that I did not cut off from My altar would make your eyes weep and your soul grieve. So all the increase of your household will die as young men. 
2:34 Now this will be the sign to you that will come on your two sons—Hophni and Phinehas—on the same day both of them will die. 
2:35 “Yet I will raise up for Myself a faithful </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
2:36 Anyone left in your household will come and bow low to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and will say: ‘Please, assign me to one of the priestly offices so that I may eat a morsel of bread.’”
3:1 Now the boy Samuel was in the service of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:2 One day, Eli was lying down in his place—now his eyes had grown dim so that he could not see, 
3:3 and the lamp of God had not yet gone out. Samuel was lying down in </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:4 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:5 Then he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he replied, “I didn’t call—go back to sleep.” So he went back and lay down. 
3:6 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:7 Now Samuel had not experienced </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:8  was calling the boy. 
3:9 So Eli said to Samuel, “Go back to sleep, and if He calls you, say: ‘Speak, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:10 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:11 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:12 In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end. 
3:13 For I have told him that I am about to judge his house forever for the iniquity that he knew about, because his sons brought a curse on themselves yet he did not rebuke them. 
3:14 Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.” 
3:15 Then Samuel lay down until the morning, when he opened the doors of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:16 Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” “Here I am,” he replied. 
3:17 “What is the word that He has spoken to you?” he said. “Please don’t hide it from me. May God do so to you and even more if you hide anything at all from me that He spoke to you.” 
3:18 So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing. Then Eli said, “He is </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:19 So Samuel grew up and </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:20 Then all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was entrusted as a prophet of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:21 . 
4:1 So it was that the word of Samuel went forth to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines in battle. They camped at Eben-ezer while the Philistines camped in Aphek. 
4:2 The Philistines drew up in battle array to meet Israel, and when the battle was fought, Israel was defeated before the Philistines, who killed 4,000 men on the battlefield. 
4:3 When the people came back to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why did </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:4 So the people sent to Shiloh, and from there they carried the ark of the covenant of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:5 Now when the ark of the covenant of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:6 When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they wondered, “What’s this noise of a great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?” When they realized that the ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:7 the Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp.” So they said, “Woe to us! For nothing like this has ever happened before. 
4:8 Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of this mighty God? This is the God that struck down the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. 
4:9 Be strong, and conduct yourselves like men, O Philistines, or else you will become enslaved to the Hebrews as they have been to you. Be like men and fight!” 
4:10 So the Philistines did fight and Israel was defeated—they fled every man to his tent. The slaughter was very great, as 30,000 of Israel’s foot soldiers fell. 
4:11 Moreover, the ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons Hophni and Phinehas died. 
4:12 Now that same day a man of Benjamin ran from the battlefield and came to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dust on his head. 
4:13 When he arrived, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the wayside watching, for his heart was trembling for the ark of God. When the man arrived to announce it in the town, the entire town cried out. 
4:14 And when Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he asked, “What’s this noisy commotion?” So the man rushed and came and told Eli. 
4:15 Now Eli was 98 years old, and his eyes were fixed in a blind stare. 
4:16 Then the man said to Eli, “I am one coming from the battlefield—I escaped from the battlefield today.” “What is happening, my son?” he asked. 
4:17 And the messenger answered and said, “Israel fled before the Philistines and there has also been a great slaughter among the people. Also your two sons died—Hophni and Phinehas—and the ark of God was captured.” 
4:18 As soon as he mentioned of the ark of God, Eli fell backward from his seat beside the town gate. His neck broke and he died, for he was old and heavy. He had judged Israel 40 years. 
4:19 Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child and about to deliver. When she heard the report that the ark of God was captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she crouched down and gave birth because she was seized with her labor pains. 
4:20 As she was dying, the women attending her said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for you have brought forth a son!” But she did not respond or take it to heart. 
4:21 Then she named the child Ichabod saying, “The glory has departed from Israel”—because of the capture of the ark of God, and because of her father-in-law and her husband. 
4:22 So she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been taken!”
5:1 Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God and they brought it from Eben-ezer to Ashdod. 
5:2 The Philistines took the ark of God and brought it to the temple of Dagon, and placed it beside Dagon. 
5:3 But when the Ashdodites arose early next morning, to everyone’s surprise, Dagon had fallen to his face on the ground before the ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:4 But when they arose early the following morning, surprisingly, Dagon had fallen to his face on the ground before the ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:5 That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any who enter Dagon’s house will tread on Dagon’s threshold in Ashdod. 
5:6 Then the hand of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:7 When the men of Ashdod saw what was happening they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not stay with us, for His hand has dealt harshly against us as well as against our god Dagon.” 
5:8 So they sent word and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them and asked, “What will we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” They replied, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried over to Gath.” So they carried the ark of the God of Israel over. 
5:9 But it came about, that after they had carried it around, that the hand of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:10 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But it came about as the ark of God came to Ekron that the Ekronites cried out saying, “They’ve brought around the ark of the God of Israel to us to kill us and our people!” 
5:11 So they sent word and gathered all the lords of the Philistines and said, “Send the ark of the God of Israel away—let it go back to its own place, so it won’t kill us and our people!” For a panic of death was throughout the entire city, as God’s hand was very heavy there. 
5:12 The people who did not die were afflicted with tumors, so that the outcry of the city went up to heaven. 
6:1 After the ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:2 the Philistines summoned the priests and the diviners saying, “What should we do with the ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:3 So they said, “If you are going to send the ark of the God of Israel back, do not send it empty. For you must surely return it with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will be revealed to you why His hand has not been removed from you.” 
6:4 “What guilt offering should we return to Him?” they asked. So they said, “Five golden tumors and five golden mice—according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, for one plague was on each of you and on your lords. 
6:5 So you will make images of your tumors and images of your mice that mar the land, and you must give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps He will lighten His hand off of you, your gods and your land. 
6:6 Why harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He afflicted them, didn’t they send them away so they left? 
6:7 Now therefore get a new cart ready, two milk cows on which there has never been a yoke, hitch the cows to the cart, and return their calves home, away from them. 
6:8 Then take the ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:9 Then watch—if it goes up by the way of its own territory to Beth-shemesh, then it was He who inflicted on us this great harm. But if not, then we will know that it was not His hand that struck us; it just happened to us by chance.” 
6:10 So the people did so—they took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. 
6:11 Then they placed the ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:12 So the cows took the way straight toward Beth-shemesh—they kept along the same highway, lowing as they went, and turned aside neither to the right nor to the left. The lords of the Philistines followed them to the border of Beth-shemesh. 
6:13 Now the people of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. When they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, they rejoiced to see it. 
6:14 The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there, where there was a large stone. Then they chopped the wood of the cart and offered up the cows as a burnt ­offering to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:15 The Levites took down the ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:16 Now when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron that same day. 
6:17 So these are the golden tumors that the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:18 The golden mice also corresponded to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords—both the fortified cities and their country villages—as far as the large stone on which they had set down the ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:19 Then He struck down some of the men of Beth-shemesh because they had gazed into the ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:20 So the men of Beth-shemesh asked, “Who is able to stand before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:21 So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back the ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:1 Then the men of Kiriath-jearim came and fetched up the ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:2 From the day the ark rested in Kiriath-jearim it was a long time, 20 years, and the whole house of Israel yearned after </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:3 Then Samuel spoke to the whole house of Israel saying, “If you are returning to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:4 So </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
7:5 Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah and I will pray to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:6 So they gathered together at Mizpah, drew water and poured it out before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:7 Now when the Philistines heard that </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
7:8 So </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
7:9 Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:10 As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:11 Then the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and struck them down all the way to below Beth-car. 
7:12 Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and named Eben-ezer saying, “Thus far </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:13 So the Philistines were subdued and they did not invade the border of Israel anymore. The hand of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:14 The towns that the Philistines had taken from Israel, from Ekron to Gath, were restored to Israel, and Israel recovered its territory from the hand of the Philistines. There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites. 
7:15 Now Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
7:16 He used to go annually on a circuit to Beth-el and Gilgal and Mizpah, and would judge over Israel in all those places. 
7:17 Then his return was to Ramah, because his home was there, and from there he would judge Israel. So he built an altar to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:1 Now when Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges over Israel. 
8:2 The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second Abijah—they were judges in Beersheba. 
8:3 His sons, however, did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after dishonest gain—they took bribes and perverted justice. 
8:4 Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah, 
8:5 and said to him, “Behold, you have grown old and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint for us a king to judge us—like all the nations.” 
8:6 But the matter was displeasing in Samuel’s eyes when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” So Samuel prayed to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:7 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:8 Like all the deeds that they have done since the day I brought them out of Egypt to this day—forsaking Me and worshiping other gods—so they are doing to you also. 
8:9 So now, listen to their voice. However, you must earnestly forewarn them, and declare to them the rulings of the king who will reign over them.” 
8:10 Now Samuel reported all the words of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:11 “This will be the practice of the king that will reign over you,” he said. “He will draft your sons and assign them as his charioteers and horsemen, and they will run before his chariots. 
8:12 He will appoint them as commanders of thousands and captains of fifties, also some to plow his fields, reap his harvest, make his weapons of war and the equipment for his chariots. 
8:13 Also he will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks and bakers. 
8:14 He will seize the best of your fields, vineyards and olive groves, and give them to his courtiers. 
8:15 He will take a tenth of your grain and your vintage and give it to his officials and slaves. 
8:16 He will also take your male and female servants, your best young men and your donkeys and make them do his work. 
8:17 He will also take the tenth of your flocks. Then you yourselves will become his slaves. 
8:18 When the day comes and you cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:19 But the people refused to listen to Samuel, and they said, “No! But a king should be over us! 
8:20 So we may become like all the nations—having our king who will judge us, go out before us and fight our battles.” 
8:21 After Samuel heard all the words of the people, he reported them back in the hearing of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:22  said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice and appoint a king to reign for them.” So Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Go, each one to his town.”
9:1 Now there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish son of Abiel son of Zeror son of Becorath son of Aphiah son of a Benjamite. He was a mighty man of valor 
9:2 and he had a son whose name was Saul—young and handsome—there was no one among </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
9:3 Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. So Kish said to his son Saul, “Take now one of the servants with you, get up and look for the donkeys.” 
9:4 So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then he passed through the land of Benjamin, but still did not find them. 
9:5 When they arrived in the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant with him, “Come, let’s go back—otherwise my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us.” 
9:6 Then his servant said to him, “Behold now, there is a man of God in this town, and he is a man held in honor—everything he says is sure to come true. Now, let’s go there. Perhaps he’ll tell us the way we should go.” 
9:7 Then said Saul to his servant, “But look, if we go, what would we bring the man? For the bread is gone from our sacks, and there is nothing to bring to the man of God as a present. What do we have?” 
9:8 The servant answered Saul again and said, “Behold, I have in my hand a quarter of a shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God and he will tell us our way.” 
9:9 (Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he said, “Come, let’s go to the seer”—for today’s prophet was formerly called a seer.) 
9:10 Then Saul said to his servant, “Well said. Come, let’s go!” So they went to the town where the man of God was. 
9:11 As they went up the hill to the town, they found some girls going out to draw water, and they asked them, “Is the seer here?” 
9:12 They answered them and said, “He is there, ahead of you. Hurry now, for he has come today to the town because people have a sacrifice at the high place today. 
9:13 As soon as you enter the town, you’ll find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he must first bless the sacrifice—afterward the guests can eat. So now, get up, for you will find him at once.” 
9:14 So they went up to the town. As they were entering the town, behold, Samuel was coming out toward them to go up to the high place. 
9:15 One day before Saul came, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
9:16 “Tomorrow about this time, I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you will anoint him ruler over My people Israel. He will deliver My people from the hand of the Philistines. I have observed My people, because their cry has come to Me.” 
9:17 When Samuel saw Saul, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
9:18 Then Saul approached Samuel inside the gate and asked, “Tell me, please, where the seer’s house is?” 
9:19 Samuel answered Saul by saying, “I am the seer. Go up ahead of me to the high place. For today you will eat with me. In the morning when I send you off, I will tell you everything that is in your heart. 
9:20 As for the donkeys that you lost three days ago, don’t set your heart on them, for they have been found. Now, for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father’s household?” 
9:21 Saul answered by saying, “Am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my clan is the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? So why do you say such things to me?” 
9:22 Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and gave them a place at the head of the guests, who numbered about 30 people. 
9:23 Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion that I gave you and told you to set aside.” 
9:24 So the cook took up the thigh, raised it, and set it before Saul. Then he said, “Here is what has been reserved! Set it before you and eat, because it has been kept until this appointed time for you, since I said, ‘I have invited the people.’” So Saul ate with Samuel that day. 
9:25 When they came down from the high place to the town, he spoke with Saul on the roof. 
9:26 They rose early, and at daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the roof saying, “Get up, so I may send you off.” So Saul got up, and both of them, he and Samuel, went outside. 
9:27 As they were going down toward the edge of town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell your servant to go ahead of us and pass on, but as for you, stand still awhile, so that I may proclaim to you the word of God.”
10:1 Then Samuel took the vial of oil and poured it on his head. Then he kissed him and said, “Has </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:2 When you leave me today, you will find two men near the tomb of Rachel in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah, and they will say to you: ‘The donkeys you set out to look for have been found—behold, your father has dropped the matter about the donkeys and is worried about you saying, “What should I do about my son?’” 
10:3 Then you will go on from there until you reach the terebinth of Tabor, and there three men going up to God at Beth-el will meet you, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and the other carrying a jug of wine. 
10:4 Then they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you will receive from their hand. 
10:5 After that, you will arrive at the hill of God, where the garrison of the Philistines is. It will come about, as soon as you enter the town, that you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place, preceded by a harp, a tambourine and a flute, and they will be prophesying. 
10:6 Then the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
10:7 Now when these signs happen to you, do for yourself what the occasion requires, for God is with you. 
10:8 Afterward, you are to go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice fellowship offerings. Seven days you will wait, until I come to you and instruct you what you should do.” 
10:9 Then it happened, as Saul turned his back to leave Samuel, that God transformed his heart, and all those signs came to pass that day. 
10:10 When they arrived there, at the hill, behold, a band of prophets did meet him, and suddenly, the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
10:11 So when all who knew him formerly saw him prophesying with the prophets, they said one to another, “What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
10:12 (Someone there asked, “Who is their father?”) Therefore it became a proverb, “Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
10:13 When he finished prophesying, he came to the high place. 
10:14 Now Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where did you go?” And he said, “To look for the donkeys. But when we saw that they could not be found, we went to Samuel.” 
10:15 Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me now, what did Samuel say to you?” 
10:16 “He assured us that the donkeys had been found,” Saul said to his uncle. But concerning the matter of kingship about which Samuel spoke, he told him nothing. 
10:17 Then Samuel summoned the people to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:18 He said to </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
10:19 But today you have spurned your God, who is your deliverer from all your calamities and your distresses. For you said to Him: ‘No! Rather set a king over us.’ Now therefore present yourselves before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:20 So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen. 
10:21 Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin by its clans, and the clan of the Matrites was chosen. Finally, Saul son of Kish was chosen. But when they looked for him, he could not be found. 
10:22 Therefore, they inquired of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:23 So they ran and brought him from there. When he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders up. 
10:24 Then Samuel announced to all the people, “Do you see the one </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:25 Then Samuel explained to the people the rules of kingship, wrote them in a scroll and placed it before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:26 Saul also went home to Gibeah, accompanied by men of valor whose hearts God had touched. 
10:27 But certain worthless men said, “How can this one save us?” So they despised him and brought him no present. But he kept silent. 
11:1 Now Nahash the Ammonite marched up and encamped against Jabesh-gilead. Then all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.” 
11:2 But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “Only on this condition will I make a treaty with you—by gouging out the right eye of every one of you, thus I will bring disgrace on all Israel.” 
11:3 So the elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days’ respite, so we may send messengers throughout all the territory of Israel. If no one comes to deliver us, we will surrender to you.” 
11:4 When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and spoke these words in the hearing of the people, all the people lifted up their voice and wept. 
11:5 Now behold, Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen, so Saul asked, “Why are the people weeping?” Then they told him the words of the men of Jabesh. 
11:6 Then the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
11:7 So he took a pair of oxen, cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers saying, “Whoever does not come out after Saul and after Samuel, so will it be done to his oxen.” So the dread of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:8 He numbered them in Bezek, and </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
11:9 So they said to the messengers who came, “Thus will you say to the men of Jabesh-gilead: Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you will have deliverance.” The messengers came and told the men of Jabesh, and they were glad. 
11:10 Then the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will surrender to you and you can do to us whatever seems good to you.” 
11:11 So it was on the following day that Saul divided the people into three columns; they penetrated into the midst of the camp at the morning watch and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of day. It came about that the survivors were scattered, so that no two of them were left together. 
11:12 Then the people said to Samuel, “Who was it who said, ‘Should Saul reign over us?’ Bring the men, so we may put them to death.” 
11:13 But Saul replied, “No man will be put to death this day, for today </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:14 Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let’s go to Gilgal and reaffirm the kingdom there.” 
11:15 So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:1 Then Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have listened to your voice in all you said to me, and have set a king over you. 
12:2 Now here is the king who will go before you, while I am old and gray. Also here are my sons with you. I have gone before you from my youth to this day. 
12:3 Here I am. Witness against me before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:4 They replied, “You haven’t defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from anyone’s hand.” 
12:5 Then he said to them, “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:6 Then Samuel said to the people, “It is </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:7 So now, stand still, so that I may plead with you before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:8 When Jacob entered Egypt and your fathers cried out to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:9 But they forgot </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:10 So they cried out to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:11 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:12 But when you saw Nahash king of the Ammonites marching against you, you said to me, ‘No! But a king must reign over us!’—even though </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:13 “Now therefore, here is the king whom you have chosen and whom you have asked for, and behold, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:14 If you fear </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:15 But if you do not listen to the voice of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:16 Now stand by and see this great thing that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:17 Is it not wheat harvest season today? I will call to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:18 So Samuel prayed to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:19 and all the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:20 Samuel said to the people, “Fear not! Indeed you have done all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:21 Do not turn aside to go after empty things that cannot profit or deliver, for they are futile. 
12:22 For </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:23 Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:24 Only fear </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:25 But if you persist in acting wickedly, you will be swept away, both you and your king.”
13:1 Saul was 30 years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for 42 years over Israel. 
13:2 Now Saul chose for himself 3,000 men of Israel, of which 2,000 were with Saul in Michmas and in the hill country of Beth-el, and 1,000 were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the troops he sent away, each one to his tent. 
13:3 Now Jonathan struck down the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. So Saul blew the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shofar
13:4 All Israel heard the news, “Saul had struck down the garrison of the Philistines, so Israel has become a stench to the Philistines.” Then the people were summoned to Saul at Gilgal. 
13:5 Meanwhile the Philistines assembled themselves to fight with Israel: 30,000 chariots, 6,000 horsemen and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They marched up and camped in Michmas, east of Beth-aven. 
13:6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble, because the people were hard-pressed, they hid in caves, thickets, cliffs, crevices and pits. 
13:7 Some of the Hebrews even crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But as for Saul, he was still in Gilgal, but all the people following him were trembling. 
13:8 So he waited seven days—the time set by Samuel—but Samuel had not come to Gilgal so the people began to scatter from him. 
13:9 Then Saul said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings,” so he offered the burnt offering. 
13:10 But as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold Samuel arrived. Saul went out to meet and greet him. 
13:11 But Samuel asked, “What have you done?” Saul replied, “Because I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you had not come within the appointed days, and that the Philistines were assembling at Michmas, 
13:12 I thought: ‘Now the Philistines are about to advance against me at Gilgal, but I have not yet entreated </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:13 Samuel said to Saul, “You have acted foolishly by not keeping the commandment of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:14 But now your kingship will not last. </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:15 Samuel then departed and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Then Saul numbered the troops that were with him, about 600 men. 
13:16 Now Saul and his son Jonathan and the people that were present with them were staying in Gibeah of Benjamin, while the Philistines encamped in Michmas. 
13:17 Raiders started to come out from the camp of the Philistines in three detachments: one detachment turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual, 
13:18 another detachment turned toward Beth-horon, and the third detachment turned toward the border road overlooking the Zeboim Wadi toward the wilderness. 
13:19 Now no blacksmith could be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!” 
13:20 So all the Israelites had to go down to the Philistines, each to sharpen his plowshare, his sickle, his axe or his hoe. 
13:21 The price of sharpening was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshares, the sickles, the three-pronged forks or the axes, or to set the oxgoads.
13:22 So it came about on the day of battle, there was no sword or spear to be found in the hand of any of the troops that were with Saul and Jonathan—only Saul and his son Jonathan had them. 
13:23 Then the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmas.
14:1 One day Jonathan son of Saul said to the young man carrying his armor, “Come, let’s cross over to the Philistines’ garrison that’s on the other side.” But he did not tell his father. 
14:2 Now Saul was sitting on the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree that is in Migron, and the troops with him were about 600 men. 
14:3 Ahijah son of Ahitub, the brother of Ichabod son of Phinehas son of Eli, the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
14:4 Between the crossings by which Jonathan sought to cross over to the Philistines’ garrison, there was a rocky crag on one side and another rocky crag on the other side—one was called Bozez and the other Seneh. 
14:5 One crag was to the north near Michmas, and the other to the south near Geba. 
14:6 Then Jonathan said to the young man carrying his armor, “Come, let’s cross over to the garrison of these uncircumcised ones. Perhaps </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:7 His armor-bearer answered him, “Do whatever is in your heart; go ahead—I’m with you whatever your heart decides.” 
14:8 Then Jonathan said, “Here, we’ll cross over to the men, then let them see us. 
14:9 If they say to us: ‘Wait till we come to you,’ then we’ll stand still in our place and will not go up to them. 
14:10 But if they say, ‘Come up to us!’ then we will go up, for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:11 So they both let themselves be seen by the Philistine garrison. “Look, some Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they were hiding,” the Philistines said. 
14:12 So the men of the garrison shouted down to Jonathan and his armor-bearer saying, “Come up to us and we’ll teach you a lesson!” Then Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Follow me, for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:13 So Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer behind him. Then they fell before Jonathan, his armor-bearer behind him finishing them off. 
14:14 That first assault that Jonathan and his armor-bearer made struck down about 20 men within about half a furrow in an acre of land. 
14:15 Terror then spread through the camp, in the field, and among all the troops. Even the outposts and the raiders also trembled, when the earth quaked—it was a trembling from God. 
14:16 Now Saul’s watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin saw the throng scattering away in every direction.
14:17 So Saul said to the people who were with him, “Call the roll now and see who went from us.” When they called the roll, behold Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there. 
14:18 Then Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here.” For the ark of God at that time was with </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
14:19 But while Saul was talking to the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
14:20 Then Saul and all the people with him rallied and rushed into the battle. Behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow in utter confusion! 
14:21 Now there were Hebrews who had defected to the Philistines previously and had gone up with them to their camp round about—even they joined the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan. 
14:22 Also when all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, they also chased after them in the battle. 
14:23 So </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:24 Now the men of Israel were hard-pressed that day, for Saul put the people under oath saying, “Cursed be the man that eats any food before evening, until I have avenged myself on my enemies!” So none of the people tasted food. 
14:25 But when all the people of the land entered the forest, there was honey on the ground. 
14:26 When the people entered the forest, indeed, there was a flow of honey, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath. 
14:27 But Jonathan had not heard when his father made the people swear the oath. So he put out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb, put his hand to his mouth—and his eyes brightened. 
14:28 Then, one of the soldiers told him, “Your father strictly put the people under oath saying: ‘Cursed be the man that eats food today.’ But the troops are exhausted.” 
14:29 Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the people. Just look how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey. 
14:30 How much more, if only the troops had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies that they found? Wouldn’t the slaughter among the Philistines have then been greater?” 
14:31 That day they struck down the Philistines from Michmas to Aijalon, though the people were so weary. 
14:32 Then the people rushed greedily upon the plunder, took sheep, oxen and calves, butchered them on the ground, and the people ate them with the blood. 
14:33 Then they reported to Saul saying, “Behold, the people are sinning against </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:34 Then Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people and tell them: ‘Each one of you bring me his ox or his sheep, and butcher them here and eat. Don’t sin against </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:35 Then Saul built an altar to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:36 Then Saul said, “Let’s go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light, we won’t leave any survivors among them.” “Do whatever seems good in your eyes,” they replied. Then the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
14:37 So Saul inquired of God, “Should I go down after the Philistines? Will You deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But He did not answer him that day. 
14:38 Then Saul said, “Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people; investigate and see how this sin was committed today. 
14:39 For as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:40 So he said to all Israel, “You stand on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other side.” “Do what seems good in your eyes,” said the people to Saul. 
14:41 So Saul said to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:42 Then Saul said, “Cast the lots between me and my son Jonathan,” and Jonathan was taken. 
14:43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you’ve done.” Jonathan told him saying, “I certainly did taste a little honey—with the end of the rod that was in my hand. Here I am—I must die!” 
14:44 “May God do so to me and even more,” Saul said. “You must surely die, Jonathan.” 
14:45 But the people said to Saul, “Must Jonathan die? It was he who brought about this great deliverance in Israel! Far be it! As </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:46 Then Saul broke off pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own country. 
14:47 After Saul had secured his kingship over Israel, he waged war against all his enemies on every side—against Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he punished them. 
14:48 He did so with valor, ­defeating the Amalekites and delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them. 
14:49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malchi-shua; and the names of his two daughters were: the name of the firstborn Merab and the name of the younger Michal. 
14:50 The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner son of Ner, Saul’s uncle. 
14:51 Kish was Saul’s father, and Abner’s father was Ner son of Abiel. 
14:52 Now there was bitter war against the Philistines all the days of Saul. So whenever Saul saw any mighty man or any son of valor, he would gather him to himself. 
15:1 Then Samuel said to Saul, “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:2 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:3 Now go and strike down Amalek and put all he has under the ban of destruction—so have no pity on him; but kill both men and women, children and nursing infants, oxen and sheep, camels and donkeys.’” 
15:4 So Saul summoned the troops and numbered them in Telaim: 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah. 
15:5 Saul advanced to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley. 
15:6 Then Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, get down from among the Amalekites, or else I may destroy you with them—for you showed kindness to all </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
15:7 Then Saul struck down the Amalekites from Havilah until you come to Shur, which is close to Egypt. 
15:8 He captured King Agag of Amalek alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. 
15:9 But Saul and the people spared Agag as well as the best of the sheep, the cattle, even the fatlings and the lambs, and all that was good, since they were not willing to utterly destroy them; everything that was worthless and feeble, they destroyed completely. 
15:10 Then the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:11 “I regret that I made Saul king, for he has turned back from following Me and has not carried out My commands.” So Samuel was troubled and cried out to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:12 Then Samuel rose early in the morning to confront Saul. But it was reported to Samuel saying, “Saul went to Carmel—for some reason, he erected a monument for himself. Then he turned and went down to Gilgal.” 
15:13 Now when Samuel reached Saul, Saul said to him, “Blessed are you of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:14 But Samuel said, “Then what is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?” 
15:15 “They brought them from the Amalekites,” Saul replied, “for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:16 “Stop!” Samuel said to Saul. “Let me tell you what </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:17 Then Samuel said, “Isn’t it true, though you were insignificant in your own eyes, that you were made head of the tribes of Israel? </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:18 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:19 Why then did you not obey the voice of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:20 “But I did obey the voice of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:21 But the people took some of the spoil, sheep and oxen—the best of what was under the ban of destruction— to sacrifice to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:22 Samuel said: “Does </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:23 For rebellion is like the sin of divination and stubbornness is like iniquity and idolatry. Since you have rejected </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:24 Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned! For I have transgressed against the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:25 So now, please pardon my sin and return with me, that I may worship </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:26 But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you, for you have rejected the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:27 As Samuel turned about to go, Saul seized the edge of his robe, and it tore. 
15:28 Then Samuel said to him, “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:29 Moreover, the Eternal Glory of Israel does not lie or change His mind. For He is not human that He should change His mind.” 
15:30 Then Saul said, “I have sinned! But please, honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me until I bow in worship to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:31 So Samuel returned after Saul, and Saul bowed in worship to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:32 Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag the king of Amalek.” Agag approached him in chains, thinking, “Surely bitter death has turned back.” 
15:33 Then Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women.” Then Samuel cut Agag into pieces before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:34 Samuel then went to Ramah, while Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul. 
15:35 Samuel never did see Saul again until the day of his death. Yet Samuel mourned over Saul, while </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:1 Now </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:2 But Samuel replied, “How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me.” </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:3 Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will let you know what you are to do. You will anoint for Me whom I tell you.” 
16:4 So Samuel did what </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:5 “In </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom
16:6 Upon their arrival, he saw Eliab and thought, “Surely, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:7 But </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:8 Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. But he said, “Neither has </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:9 Then Jesse made Shammah pass by and again he said, “Neither has </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:10 Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:11 Then Samuel asked Jesse, “Are these all the boys you have?” “There’s still the youngest,” he replied. But right now, he’s tending the sheep.” “Send and bring him,” Samuel said to Jesse, “for we will not sit down until he comes here.” 
16:12 So he sent word and had him come. Now he was ruddy-cheeked, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:13 So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. From that day on </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
16:14 Now the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
16:15 So Saul’s courtiers said to him, “Behold now, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. 
16:16 Let our lord now command your courtiers in your service to search for a man who is a skillful player on the harp. Then whenever the evil spirit from God comes on you, he will play with his instrument and you will feel better.” 
16:17 So Saul said to his courtiers, “Find me someone who can play well and bring him to me.” 
16:18 One of the young men answered and said, “I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite who is skillful in playing music. He is a mighty man of valor, a warrior, prudent in speech, a handsome man, and </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:19 So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David, who is with the flock.” 
16:20 So Jesse took a donkey, loaded it with bread, a bottle of wine and a young goat, and sent them with his son David to Saul. 
16:21 Then David came to Saul and became one of his attendants. Saul loved him greatly, so David became his armor-bearer. 
16:22 Then Saul sent word to Jesse saying, “Let David now keep attending me, for he has found favor in my eyes.” 
16:23 It came to pass, whenever the spirit from God came upon Saul, David would take the harp and play it with his hand. So Saul would find relief and feel better, as the evil spirit departed from him. 
17:1 Now the Philistines assembled their armies to battle. They were gathered at Socoh of Judah, and camped in Ephes-dammim, between Socoh and Azekah. 
17:2 Saul and the men of Israel gathered and camped in the valley of Elah, then lined up in battle array against the Philistines. 
17:3 The Philistines were standing on the mountain on one side, and Israel was standing on the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them. 
17:4 Then a champion stepped out from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, from Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. 
17:5 He had a bronze helmet on his head and a breastplate of scale armor; the weight of the bronze breastplate was 5,000 shekels. 
17:6 He also had bronze shin-guards on his legs and a bronze javelin slung between his shoulders. 
17:7 The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and the head of his spear weighed 600 shekels of iron; and his shield-bearer was marching ahead of him. 
17:8 Then he stood and shouted out to the ranks of Israel saying to them, “Why come out to line up in battle array? Am I not the Philistine and aren’t you Saul’s servants? Choose for yourselves a man and let him come down to me. 
17:9 If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then will we become your slaves; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then will you become our slaves and serve us.” 
17:10 The Philistine added, “Today I defy the ranks of Israel—give me a man, so we may fight together!” 
17:11 But when Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and very terrified. 
17:12 Now David was son of a certain Ephrathite man of Beth-lehem of Judah, whose name was Jesse. He had eight sons and during the days of Saul the man was old, advanced in years among men. 
17:13 Now the three oldest sons of Jesse had already left and gone after Saul to the battle; the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and second to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. 
17:14 David was the youngest. So the three oldest followed Saul. 
17:15 Now David would go back and forth from Saul to tending his father’s sheep by Beth-lehem. 
17:16 For forty days that Philistine would come out every morning and evening to present himself. 
17:17 Then Jesse said to his son David, “Take now, for your brothers, an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers. 
17:18 Also take these ten slices of cheese to the captain of their thousand—and check out the welfare of your brothers and bring back some token from them. 
17:19 They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.” 
17:20 So David rose up early in the morning, left the flock with a keeper, took the provisions and went as Jesse had commanded him. When he reached the camp, the army was going out to the battle line shouting the war cry. 
17:21 Israel and the Philistines drew up their battle lines, army against army. 
17:22 Then David left his baggage in the care of the baggage keeper, and ran to the battle line and entered to check out his brothers’ welfare. 
17:23 But as he was talking with them, behold the champion, the Philistine from Gath named Goliath, was coming up from the ranks of the Philistines, and he spoke these same words; and David heard them. 
17:24 Upon seeing him, all the men of Israel fled from him in great fear. 
17:25 All the men of Israel were saying, “Have you seen this man who keeps coming up? Surely he is coming up to defy Israel! The man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, give him his daughter in marriage and make his father’s house tax-free in Israel!” 
17:26 Then David asked the men who were standing by him saying, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the ranks of the living God?” 
17:27 The people answered him with the same speech saying, “Thus it will be done for the man who strikes him down.” 
17:28 Now when Eliab his oldest brother heard him speaking to the men, Eliab’s anger was kindled against David. “Why have you come down here?” he asked. “So with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your insolence and the wickedness of your heart! For you’ve come down here to watch the battle.” 
17:29 “What have I done now?” David said. “It was only a question!” 
17:30 Then he turned away from him toward someone else and asked the same question. So the people gave him the same answer as before. 
17:31 The words that David said were overheard and reported before Saul. So he was taken to him. 
17:32 David said to Saul, “Let no one’s heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” 
17:33 Then Saul said to David, “You can’t go fight this Philistine—for you’re just a youth, and he’s been a warrior since his youth.” 
17:34 But David said to Saul, “Your servant has been tending his father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a lamb out of the flock, 
17:35 I went out after it, struck it down, and rescued the lamb out of its mouth. If it rose up against me, I grabbed him by its fur, struck it and killed it. 
17:36 Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear, so this uncircumcised Philistine will become like one of them—since he has defied the ranks of the living God.” 
17:37 Then David said, “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:38 Then Saul clothed David with his own garb, put a bronze helmet on his head, and clothed him in armor. 
17:39 David strapped his sword on his garment and tried to walk, but he was not used to it. So David said to Saul, “I cannot walk in these, for I am not used to them.” So David took them off. 
17:40 Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the valley, put them in the pocket of the shepherd’s bag that he had, and with his sling in his hand, he approached the Philistine. 
17:41 Meanwhile, the Philistine drew nearer and approached David, with his shield-bearer in front of him. 
17:42 Now when the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was just a ruddy boy with a handsome appearance. 
17:43 Then the Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” Then the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 
17:44 The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, so I may give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field.” 
17:45 Then David said to the Philistine, “You are coming to me with a sword, a spear and a javelin, but I am coming to you in the Name of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:46 This very day </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:47 and so all this assembly will know that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:48 Then when the Philistine rose and began to advance, drawing near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. 
17:49 David put his hand in his bag, took from it a stone and slung it, striking the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, so that he fell on his face to the ground. 
17:50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, struck the Philistine down and killed him. Since there was no sword in David’s hand, 
17:51 David ran, stood over the Philistine, picked up his sword, drew it from its sheath, slew him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. 
17:52 Then the men of Israel and Judah rose up, shouted and pursued the Philistines all the way to the valley up to the gates of Ekron. The slain Philistines fell down along the way to Shaaraim, even up to Gath and Ekron. 
17:53 When </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
17:54 David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his own tent. 
17:55 Now when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he asked Abner, the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this boy?” Abner said, “As your soul lives, your majesty, I don’t know.” 
17:56 So the king said, “Then, find out whose son this young man is.” 
17:57 So when David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 
17:58 “Whose son are you, young man?” Saul said to him. David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.”
18:1 Now it came to pass, when David had finished speaking to Saul, Jonathan’s soul was knit to David’s soul, and Jonathan loved him as himself. 
18:2 Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father’s house. 
18:3 Then Jonathan cut a covenant with David, because he loved him as himself. 
18:4 Jonathan stripped off the robe that was on him and gave it to David, along with his armor: his sword, bow and belt.
18:5 So David went out wherever Saul sent him and had success, so Saul set him over the men of war. It was pleasing in the eyes of all the people as well as in the eyes of Saul’s courtiers. 
18:6 Upon their coming back, upon David’s return from killing the Philistine, the women came out of all the towns of Israel, singing and dancing in circles to greet King Saul, with timbrels, with joy and with three-stringed instruments. 
18:7 So the women sang one to another, as they were dancing saying, “Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands!” 
18:8 Then Saul became very angry—this saying was evil in his eyes—and he commented, “They’ve ascribed to David ten thousands and to me they’ve ascribed thousands. Now what more does he lack but the kingdom?” 
18:9 So Saul eyed David from that day on. 
18:10 It came about the next day that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, so that he was raving within the palace. While David was playing music with his hand, as he did day by day, Saul had his spear in his hand, 
18:11 and Saul hurled the spear, thinking, “I’ll pin David to the wall!” But David eluded him—twice. 
18:12 Now Saul became afraid of David, because </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:13 Therefore Saul removed him from his entourage by appointing him as a captain of a thousand. So David went out and came in before the troops. 
18:14 David had success in all his undertakings, since </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:15 When Saul saw that he had great success, he dreaded him. 
18:16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them. 
18:17 Then Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab—I give her to you as a wife. Only continue to be my son of valor and fight </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:18 But David replied to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my life or my father’s family in Israel, that I should become the king’s son-in-law?” 
18:19 But when it was time to give Saul’s daughter Merab to David in marriage, she was given as wife to Adriel the Meholathite instead.
18:20 Now Saul’s daughter Michal loved David. When they told Saul, the matter pleased him. 
18:21 Saul thought, “I will give her to him, so that she may become a snare to him—and the hand of the Philistines will be against him.” So Saul said to David, “You can still become my son-in-law, even today, with the second one.” 
18:22 Then Saul commanded his courtiers, “Speak with David privately and say, ‘Behold, the king delights in you and all his courtiers love you. So now, become the king’s son-in-law!’” 
18:23 So Saul’s courtiers whispered these words in David’s ears. But David said, “Is it a light thing to you becoming the king’s son-in-law, considering that I am a poor man and of little account?” 
18:24 Saul’s courtiers reported back to him what David had said. 
18:25 Then Saul said, “Thus you will say to David, ‘The king desires no bridal dowry except 100 foreskins of the Philistines—to take vengeance on the king’s enemies.’” So Saul schemed to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. 
18:26 When his courtiers told David these words, the word seemed right in David’s eyes to become the king’s son-in-law. Before the days were fulfilled, 
18:27  David had risen, gone with his men and killed 200 Philistine men. Then David brought their foreskins and gave them in full number to the king—to become the king’s son-in-law. So Saul gave him Michal his daughter as a wife. 
18:28 When Saul saw and realized that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:29 Saul grew even more afraid of David. Thus Saul became David’s enemy for all days. 
18:30 When the chiefs of the Philistines marched out, as often as they came out, David proved more successful than all of Saul’s officers. So his name became highly esteemed. 
19:1 Now Saul told his son Jonathan and all his courtiers to kill David. But Saul’s son Jonathan delighted much in David. 
19:2 So Jonathan informed David saying, “My father Saul is seeking to kill you. So now, please be on guard in the morning, and stay in a secret place and hide yourself. 
19:3 I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you will be, and I will speak with my father about you. If I notice anything, I will tell you.” 
19:4 So Jonathan spoke well of David to his father Saul and said to him, “May the king not sin against his servant David, since he has not sinned against you, and since his deeds have been very beneficial for you; 
19:5 For he put his life in his hand and killed the Philistine, and </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:6 Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore, “As </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:7 So Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these things. Jonathan brought David to Saul and in his presence as before. 
19:8 Once again war broke out, and David marched out and fought the Philistines, and inflicted a great slaughter on them and they fled before him. 
19:9 Yet once again an evil spirit from </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:10 Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away from Saul’s face, so that he drove the spear into the wall. That night David fled and got away. 
19:11 Then Saul sent agents to David’s house to watch him, in order to kill him in the morning. But David’s wife Michal warned him saying, “If you don’t escape for your life tonight, tomorrow you will be dead!” 
19:12 So Michal lowered David down through the window, and thus he went, fled and escaped. 
19:13 Then Michal took a household idol, laid it in the bed, put a quilt of goats’ hair at the head and covered it with a cloth. 
19:14 When Saul sent messengers to arrest David, she said, “He’s sick.” 
19:15 So Saul sent the agents back to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed so I may put him to death.” 
19:16 When the messengers came in, behold, the household idol was in the bed with the quilt of goats’ hair at its head. 
19:17 Saul then said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy get away, so that he escaped?” Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go or I’ll kill you!’” 
19:18 So David fled and escaped, went to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went and stayed at Naioth. 
19:19 Saul was told, “Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.” 
19:20 So Saul sent agents to seize David, but they saw a band of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing and presiding over them. Then the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
19:21 When Saul was told, he sent other agents and they too prophesied. Then Saul sent a third group of messengers, and they too prophesied. 
19:22 Then he himself went to Ramah, and when he arrived at the great cistern in Secu, he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” Someone answered, “Look, they are at Naioth at Ramah.” 
19:23 So he proceeded there, to Naioth at Ramah, and the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
19:24 Then he too stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. That is why people were saying, “Is Saul too among the prophets?”
20:1 Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah, came before Jonathan and said, “What have I done? What is my crime? What is my sin against your father that he should be seeking my life?” 
20:2 “Never!” he said to him. “You will not die! Behold, my father does nothing great or small without disclosing it to me. So why should my father hide this matter from me? It cannot be.” 
20:3 Then David swore again saying, “Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes. So he must have thought, ‘Let’s not let Jonathan know about this, else he will be grieved.’ But truly as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:4 Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you!” 
20:5 So David said to Jonathan, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon, when I am supposed to sit down with the king to eat. Instead, let me go hide myself in the countryside until the third evening. 
20:6 If your father misses me at all, then say: ‘David earnestly asked my permission to run to Beth-lehem, his town, for it is the annual sacrifice there for the whole family.’ 
20:7 If he says thus, ‘Very well,’ then your servant is safe; but if he becomes very angry, then know that he is determined to harm me. 
20:8 Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:9 Jonathan replied, “Far be it from you! For if I know for sure that my father has determined evil to come on you, then wouldn’t I tell you about it?” 
20:10 Then David asked Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?” 
20:11 Jonathan said to David, “Come, let’s go out to the field.” So they both went out to the field. 
20:12 Then Jonathan said to David, “By </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:13 May </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:14 “Now if I am still alive, wouldn’t you show me the loyal love of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:15 Yet also, don’t cut off your loyal love from my household ever—not even when </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:16 So Jonathan cut a covenant with the house of David, “So may </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:17 Jonathan made David swear again because of the love he had for him, for he loved him as he loved himself. 
20:18 Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the New Moon. You’ll be missed because your seat will be empty. 
20:19 On the third day, you must go down quickly and come to the place where you hid as you did on that day, and remain close to the stone Ezel. 
20:20 I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target. 
20:21 Now look, I will send a lad saying, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I specifically say to the lad, ‘See, the arrows are on this side of you—get them,’ then come; for it is safe for you and no danger, as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:22 But if I say to the boy: ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then go your way, for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:23 But as for the matter which I and you have spoken about, behold, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:24 So David hid himself in the field, and when the New Moon came, the king sat down to eat a meal. 
20:25 So the king sat on his seat—as usual, the seat by the wall—Jonathan stood up and Abner sat down by Saul’s side, but David’s place was empty. 
20:26 Nevertheless, Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, “It must be an accident; he must be ceremonially unclean—yes, that’s it, he’s unclean.” 
20:27 Yet it came to pass on the day following the New Moon, the second day, that David’s place was still empty. So Saul asked his son Jonathan, “Why didn’t Jesse’s son come to the meal yesterday or today?” 
20:28 Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem, 
20:29 as he said, ‘Please let me go, for we are going to have a family feast in the town, and my brother has commanded me. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me go, please, to see my brothers. That’s why he hasn’t come to the king’s table.” 
20:30 Then Saul’s rage blazed against Jonathan and he said to him, “You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Don’t I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse—to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness? 
20:31 For as long as the son of Jesse lives on earth, neither you nor your kingship will be secure. Now, send word and bring him to me, for he is a son of death!” 
20:32 But Jonathan answered his father Saul, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?” 
20:33 Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him down. So Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death. 
20:34 So Jonathan rose up from the table in fierce anger, and did not eat food the second day of the new month, for he was grieved over David, because his father had dishonored him. 
20:35 It came to pass in the morning that Jonathan went out to the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad was with him. 
20:36 He said to his lad, “Run, find now the arrows that I am about to shoot.” Now as the lad was running, he shot an arrow past him. 
20:37 When the lad reached the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried out after the lad and said, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?” 
20:38 Then Jonathan called out after the lad, “Quick, hurry! Don’t stand there!” So Jonathan’s lad picked up the arrow and came to his master. 
20:39 But the lad knew nothing; only Jonathan and David knew the arrangement. 
20:40 Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad and said to him, “Go, take them back to the town.” 
20:41 As soon as the lad was gone, David emerged from the south side and fell on his face to the ground and bowed down three times. Then they kissed each other and wept together, though David wept more. 
20:42 Then Jonathan said to David, “Go in the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom
21:1 Then David got up and left, while Jonathan returned to the town. 
21:2 David went to Nob to Ahimelech the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
21:3 David said to Ahimelech the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
21:4 So now, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever can be found.” 
21:5 The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
21:6 “Of course women have been kept from us, as on previous campaigns,” David answered the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
21:7 So the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
21:8 Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:9 Then David said to Ahimelech, “Isn’t there a spear or sword on hand? For I did not take my sword or my weapons with me, because the king’s mission was urgent.” 
21:10 The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
21:11 Then David got up and fled that day from Saul, and went to Achish, king of Gath. 
21:12 But Achish’s courtiers said to him, “Isn’t this David king of the land? Isn’t he the one they sing about in their dances saying, ‘Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?’” 
21:13 David took these words to heart, and he became so afraid of King Achish of Gath 
21:14 that he changed his demeanor before them and acted like a mad man while in their hands—scribbling on the doors of the gate and letting his saliva run down his beard. 
21:15 Then Achish said to his courtiers, “Look, you can see the man is insane. Why did you bring him to me? 
22:1 So David walked from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father’s house heard about it, they went down there to him. 
22:2 Anyone who was in distress, anyone in debt, and anyone embittered rallied around him, and he became their leader. There were about 400 men with him. 
22:3 Then David left from there to Mizpah of Moab, and he said to the king of Moab, “Please, let my father and my mother come and stay with you until I know what God will do for me.” 
22:4 Then he brought them to the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold. 
22:5 But the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold; depart, and go to the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth. 
22:6 Then Saul heard that David and the men with him were located. Saul was in Gibeah, sitting under the tamarisk tree on the height, spear in his hand, and all his courtiers were attending him. 
22:7 Saul said to his courtiers standing about him, “Listen now, Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you captains of thousands and captains of hundreds? 
22:8 Yet all of you have conspired against me, and there was nobody disclosing to me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse! None of you is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me to lie in ambush—as is the case today?” 
22:9 Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing among Saul’s courtiers, answered and said, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob—to Ahimelech son of Ahitub—
22:10 and he inquired of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:11 Then the king sent word to summon the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
22:12 “Listen now, son of Ahitub,” Saul said. “Here I am, my lord,” he said. 
22:13 Then Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me—you and the son of Jesse—by giving him bread and a sword, and by inquiring of God for him, that he should rise against me by lying in ambush, as is the case today?” 
22:14 Then Ahimelech answered the king saying, “Who among all your servants is as trusted as David, the king’s son-in-law, a captain of the royal guard, and honored in your house? 
22:15 Just today I began to inquire of God for him? Far be it from the king to accuse his servant or to anyone of my father’s house. For your servant knows nothing of all this, whether little or much.” 
22:16 But the king said, “You will surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s house.” 
22:17 Then the king ordered the guards attending him, “Turn around and kill the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
22:18 So the king said to Doeg, “You, turn around and kill the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
22:19 Nob, the town of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
22:20 Yet one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to David. 
22:21 Abiathar told David that Saul had slain </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:22 Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have brought about the death of all the people of your father’s house. 
22:23 Stay with me, and fear not; for the one who is seeking my life is seeking your life too—but with me you will be safe.”
23:1 Then they reported to David saying, “Look, the Philistines are raiding Keilah and they are plundering the threshing floors.” 
23:2 So David inquired of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:3 But David’s fellow men said to him, “Look, we’re afraid here in Judah; how much more so if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces?” 
23:4 Once again David inquired of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:5 So David and his fellow men went to Keilah and fought against the Philistines, drove off their livestock and inflicted a great slaughter on them. Thus David rescued the inhabitants of Keilah. 
23:6 It came about, when Abiathar son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand. 
23:7 Now when Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, Saul said, “God has delivered him into my hand! For he shut himself in by entering a town with barred gates.” 
23:8 So Saul summoned all the troops for battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his fellow men. 
23:9 Now David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him, so he said to Abiathar the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
23:10 Then David said, “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:11 Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:12 Then David asked, “Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my fellow men into the hand of Saul?” “They will surrender,” </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:13 Then David and his fellow men, about 600, got up and left Keilah, and went wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he stopped the pursuit. 
23:14 So David stayed in the strongholds of the wilderness, remaining in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. Saul searched for him every day, but God did not give him into his hand. 
23:15 By now David was aware that Saul would come out to seek his life while David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Choresh. 
23:16 Then Saul’s son Jonathan arose and went to David at Choresh and strengthened him in God. 
23:17 “Don’t be afraid,” he said to him, “because my father Saul will never find you. You will be king over Israel and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul recognizes that.” 
23:18 Again they cut a covenant before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:19 Then some of the Ziphites went up to Saul in Gibeah, saying, “Isn’t David hiding with us in the strongholds at Choresh, in the hill of Hachilah which is south of Jeshimon? 
23:20 Now therefore, O king, come down whenever it is a desire of your soul to come down—our part will be to deliver him into the king’s hand.” 
23:21 “May you be blessed of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:22 Go now, make more sure, investigate and scout out his place where he usually goes and who has seen him there. For I have been told that he is very cunning. 
23:23 Look around and see in which of all the hiding places he has been hiding, and return to me with certainty, and I will go with you. If he is in the area, I will search him out among all the clans of Judah.” 
23:24 Then they got up and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. But David and his men were then in the wilderness of Maon in the Arabah, to the south of Jeshimon. 
23:25 So when Saul and his men began the search, David was informed. Then he went down to the rocky area and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. On hearing this, Saul pursued David in the wilderness of Maon. 
23:26 Then, while Saul was advancing on one side of the mountain, David and his men were on the other side of the mountain. David was hurrying to elude Saul. Meanwhile Saul and his men were closing-in on David and his men to seize them. 
23:27 But a messenger came to Saul saying, “Hurry and come, for the Philistines have invaded the land!” 
23:28 So Saul had to return from chasing after David, and go to engage the Philistines. Therefore they called that place the Rock of Separation. 
23:29 From there David went up and stayed in the strongholds of En-gedi.
24:1 Now when Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, they told him saying, “Look, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.” 
24:2 So Saul took 3,000 chosen men from all Israel and went to search for David and his men near the rocks of the mountain goats. 
24:3 When he came across the sheepfolds along the way where there was a cave, Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were already sitting in the innermost parts of the cave. 
24:4 So David’s men said to him, “Look, it’s the day </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:5 But afterward, David’s conscience bothered him for cutting off the edge of Saul’s robe. 
24:6 So he said to his fellow men, “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:7 So David persuaded his fellow men with these words and did not let them rise against Saul. Then Saul left the cave and went on his way. 
24:8 David also rose afterward, went out of the cave, and called out after Saul saying, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth and prostrated himself. 
24:9 Then David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to men’s words saying: ‘Look, David intends you harm’? 
24:10 Look, today your own eyes should see how </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:11 Moreover, my father, see! Yes, look at the corner of your robe in my hand! For in cutting off the corner of your robe, yet not killing you, you should know and realize that there is no evil or rebellion in my hand. I haven’t sinned against you, even though you are lying in wait for my life, to take it. 
24:12 May </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:13 As the old proverb goes, ‘Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness’—but my hand will never be on you. 
24:14 Whom has the king of Israel come after? Who are you chasing? A dead dog? A single flea? 
24:15 May </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:16 Now when David finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son, David?” Then Saul lifted up his voice and wept aloud. 
24:17 Then he said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have done good to me, while I have done evil to you. 
24:18 You’ve told today how well you’ve dealt with me, for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:19 For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away on a good road? May </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:20 Now behold, I know for certain that you will be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will rise in your hand. 
24:21 Swear now to me by </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:22 So David swore to Saul. Then Saul went to his home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold. 
25:1 Then Samuel died, and all Israel gathered and lamented him, and buried him at his house in Ramah. David then arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran. 
25:2 Now there was a man in Maon, whose business was in Carmel, and the man was so wealthy, he had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats. At that time he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. 
25:3 The man’s name was Nabal and his wife’s name was Abigail. The woman was intelligent and beautiful, but the man, a Calebite, was harsh and evil in his dealings. 
25:4 While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing his sheep. 
25:5 So David dispatched ten young men, and said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, and when you reach Nabal, greet him in my name. 
25:6 Thus you will say: ‘Long life! And </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom
25:7 Now I hear that you have shearers. When your shepherds were with us, we did them no harm and nothing of theirs was missing all the time they were in Carmel. 
25:8 Ask your young men and they will tell you. Therefore, let the young men find favor in your eyes, for we have come on a festive day. So please, give to your servants and to your son David, whatever you find at hand.’” 
25:9 David’s young men went and told Nabal all those words in David’s name, and waited. 
25:10 But Nabal answered David’s servants by saying, “Who is David? And who is Jesse’s son? Nowadays there are many slaves each running away from his master. 
25:11 So should I take my bread, my water and my meat that I have cooked for my shearers, and give it to men whom I don’t know where they come from?” 
25:12 So David’s young men turned around and went back. When they came and reported to him all these words, 
25:13 David said to his men, “Everyone buckle on your sword!” So each man buckled on his sword and David also buckled on his sword. About 400 men went up following David, while 200 stayed with the baggage. 
25:14 But one of the young men told Nabal’s wife Abigail saying, “Look, David had sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, but he spurned them. 
25:15 Yet the men were very good to us. We were not harmed, nor were we missing anything as long as we went about with them while we were in the fields. 
25:16 They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the time that we were with them tending the sheep. 
25:17 Now therefore, know and consider what you will do, for evil is determined against our master and against all his household. But he is such a worthless fellow that no one can speak to him.” 
25:18 Then Abigail hurried and took 200 loaves, two bottles of wine, five dressed sheep, five measures of roasted corn, 100 cakes of raisins, and 200 cakes of figs, and put them on donkeys. 
25:19 Then she said to her young men, “Go on ahead of me—see, I am coming after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal. 
25:20 As she was riding on the donkey and going down by the hidden pass of the mountain, behold, David and his men were coming down towards her, so she met them. 
25:21 Now David had been saying, “Surely in vain I’ve guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missing of all that belonged to him—yet he has returned me evil for good. 
25:22 May God do so and even more to David’s enemies if by the morning I leave even one male of all who belong to him!” 
25:23 When Abigail saw David, she quickly dismounted from her donkey, fell before David on her face and bowed down to the ground. 
25:24 As she fell at his feet, she pleaded, “On me, only me, my lord, be the punishment! But please, let your maidservant speak in your ears, and listen to the words of your maidservant. 
25:25 Please my lord, pay no attention to this worthless fellow, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he—Nabal is his name and disgraceful folly is with him. But I, your maidservant, did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent. 
25:26 “So now my lord, as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:27 Now let this blessing, which your maidservant has brought to my lord, be given to the young men who are accompanying my lord. 
25:28 Please, forgive the trespass of your maidservant. For </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:29 If anyone rises to pursue you and seek your life, then let my lord’s life be bound up in the bundle of the living—with </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:30 “So when </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:31 then this will not be a stumbling-block for you, or offense of heart to my lord, or needless bloodshed by my lord avenging himself. So when </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:32 Then David said to Abigail, “Blessed be </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:33 Blessed be your discernment, and may you be blessed for keeping me this day from shedding blood, from avenging myself with my own hand. 
25:34 Yet as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:35 So David received from her hand what she had brought him, and said to her, “Go up in </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom
25:36 Then Abigail went to Nabal, and there he was holding a banquet in his house like that of a king—Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was quite drunk. So she told him nothing at all until daybreak. 
25:37 It came to pass in the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, and his wife told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he was paralyzed like a stone. 
25:38 About ten days later, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:39 When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:40 When David’s servants came to Abigail at Carmel, they told her, “David has sent us to you, to take you as his wife.” 
25:41 So she rose, bowed down with her face to the ground and said, “Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.” 
25:42 Then Abigail rose quickly and mounted a donkey, with five of her maidens following her, following David’s messengers, and she became his wife. 
25:43 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and the two of them were his wives. 
25:44 Meanwhile Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti son of Laish, who was of Gallim. 
26:1 Now the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah saying, “Isn’t David hiding on the hill of Hachilah which faces Jeshimon?” 
26:2 So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, 3,000 chosen men of Israel with him, to search for David in the wilderness of Ziph. 
26:3 Saul camped in the hill of Hachilah which faces Jeshimon, by the road. But David was staying in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul had come after him into the wilderness. 
26:4 So David sent out spies and realized that Saul had already arrived. 
26:5 Then David got up and went to the place where Saul had camped. David detected the spot where Saul lay asleep, as well as Abner son of Ner his army commander. Saul was lying inside the barricade and the troops were camped around him. 
26:6 Then David spoke and asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” “I will go down with you,” Abishai answered. 
26:7 So David and Abishai approached the troops by night. Behold, Saul was lying asleep within the barricade with his spear stuck in the ground at his head, and Abner and the troops were sleeping around him. 
26:8 Then Abishai said to David, “God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Now let me pin him to the ground with a single thrust of the spear. I will not have to strike him twice.” 
26:9 But David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy him! For who can lay his hand on </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:10 David added, “As </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:11 ’s anointed! Now, just take the spear that is at his head and the water jar and let’s go.” 
26:12 So David took the spear and the water jar from beside Saul’s head. They got away—and no one saw it, or knew it, or woke up—for all were asleep, for a deep sleep from </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:13 Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on the top of a distant hill with a wide space between them. 
26:14 David shouted to the troops and to Abner son of Ner saying, “Aren’t you going to answer, Abner?” Then Abner answered saying, “Who are you, who called out to the king?” 
26:15 “Aren’t you a man?” David said to Abner. “Indeed, who is like you in Israel? So, why didn’t you guard your lord the king? For one of the troops came in to kill the king your lord. 
26:16 This thing that you’ve done is no good. As </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:17 Saul then recognized David’s voice and said, “Is this your voice, David my son?” “It is my voice, my lord the king,” David said, 
26:18 then added, “Yet why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done? What evil is in my hand? 
26:19 Now please, let my lord the king listen to the words of his servant. If </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:20 So now, let not my blood fall to the ground, away from the presence of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:21 Then Saul replied, “I have sinned! Return, David my son, for I will no longer do you harm, since my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold, I’ve played the fool and erred so seriously.” 
26:22 David then answered and said, “There is the king’s spear! Let one of the young men cross over and take it. 
26:23 ’s anointed. 
26:24 See, just as your life was highly valued in my eyes today, so let my life be highly valued in </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:25 Then Saul said to David, “Blessed are you, David my son! You will both do mightily and will surely prevail.” So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place. 
27:1 Then David said in his heart, “One day I’ll be swept away by the hand of Saul. There’s nothing better for me than to escape immediately to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me in all the territories of Israel, so I’ll escape from his hand.” 
27:2 So David rose and crossed over, he and the 600 men that were with him, to Achish son of Maoch, king of Gath. 
27:3 David stayed with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, and David with his two wives—Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal’s widow. 
27:4 So when Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him. 
27:5 Then David said to Achish, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, let me be given a place in one of the country towns, so I may live there. Why should your servant stay in the royal city with you?” 
27:6 So Achish granted him Ziklag that day. Thus Ziklag came to belong to the kings of Judah to this day. 
27:7 The number of days that David stayed in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months. 
27:8 Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Gizrites and the Amalekites, for those were inhabitants of the region from ancient times, as you go all the way from Shur and as far as the land of Egypt. 
27:9 David attacked the region and was leaving not a man or woman alive, and took away sheep, oxen, donkeys, camels and clothing. When he returned and came to Achish, 
27:10 Achish would ask, “Where have you raided today?” So David would reply, “Against the Negev of Judah, against the Negev of the Jerahmeelite and against the Negev of the Kenites.” 
27:11 David left no man or woman alive to bring to Gath, thinking, “Unless they should tell about us, saying: ‘So did David.’” So was his practice all the time he stayed in the country of the Philistines. 
27:12 Then Achish trusted David, saying, “He has certainly made himself abhorrent to his people Israel; therefore, he will be my vassal forever.”
28:1 At that time, the Philistines gathered their armed forces to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, “You surely know that you and your men must march out with me in the army.” 
28:2 David said to Achish, “Well then, you know what your servant will do.” “Well then, I appoint you my bodyguard for life,” Achish said to David. 
28:3 Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had lamented him and buried him in Ramah, his hometown. Saul had removed from the land those who were mediums and spiritists. 
28:4 So the Philistines mustered and came and camped in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together and they camped at Gilboa. 
28:5 Now when Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly. 
28:6 When Saul inquired of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:7 Then Saul said to his courtiers, “Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go to her and inquire through her.” So his courtiers said to him, “Behold, there is a woman that is a medium at En-dor.” 
28:8 So Saul disguised himself, put on other clothes, and went with two other men, and they reached the woman by night. Then he said, “Please conjure up for me a ghost—bring up for me the one I will name to you.” 
28:9 “Look, you know what Saul has done,” she said, “how he has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. So why then are you setting a trap for my life to get me killed?” 
28:10 Saul vowed to her by </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:11 “Whom will I bring up for you?” the woman asked. “Bring me up Samuel,” he said. 
28:12 But when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud shriek. Then the woman spoke to Saul saying, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!” 
28:13 “Don’t be afraid!” the king said to her. “What do you see?” The woman said to Saul, “I see a godlike being coming up from the earth.” 
28:14 “What does he look like?” he asked her. “An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped with a robe,” she said. Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, so he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. 
28:15 Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” “I’m in great distress,” Saul answered. “The Philistines are waging war against me, and God has turned away from me—He doesn’t answer me anymore, whether by prophets or by dreams. So I called you up to tell me what I should do.” 
28:16 Samuel said, “So why ask me, since </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:17 Now </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:18 Since you did not obey the voice of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:19 Moreover, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:20 Then Saul immediately fell full length upon the ground, and became so terrified because of the words of Samuel that there was absolutely no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night. 
28:21 Then the woman came to Saul and saw that he was so agitated, so she told him, “Behold, your maidservant obeyed you; I put my life in my hand by listening to your words, which you spoke to me. 
28:22 Please you too listen to the voice of your maidservant, and let me set a morsel of bread before you, so you can eat and have strength to go on your way.” 
28:23 But he refused and said, “I won’t eat.” But when his courtiers and the woman urged him, he listened to them. So he got up from the ground and sat on the bed. 
28:24 The woman had a fatted calf in the house, so she hurried and butchered it, and took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread from it. 
28:25 She brought it before Saul and his courtiers, and they ate. Then they arose and went away that night.
29:1 Now the Philistines mustered all their armies at Aphek, while the Israelites were camping by the spring in Jezreel. 
29:2 As the Philistine lords were proceeding ahead of their hundreds and thousands, David and his men were bringing up the rear with Achish. 
29:3 Then the Philistine commanders said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” Achish said to the Philistine commanders, “No! That’s David, servant of Israel’s King Saul—he’s been with me today for over a year, and I’ve not found any fault in him since the day he defected to me until now.” 
29:4 But the Philistine commanders got angry with him, and the Philistine commanders said to him, “Make this man go back—back to his place you assigned him. He must not go down with us to the battle, or in the battle he might become our adversary. For how would this fellow appease his lord? Wouldn’t it be with the heads of our men? 
29:5 Isn’t this one David, about whom they were singing in dances saying: ‘Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?’” 
29:6 So Achish called David and said to him, “As </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:7 So now, turn around and go back in peace, and you won’t be doing anything to displease the Philistine lords.” 
29:8 “But what have I done?” David said to Achish. “What have you found in your servant from the day I have been before you to this day, that I shouldn’t go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?” 
29:9 “I know,” Achish answered saying to David. “You are as pleasing in my eyes as an angel of God. Nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have said, ‘He must not go up with us to the battle.’ 
29:10 So now, rise up early in the morning, you and the servants of your lord that came with you, and as soon you rise, early in the morning, once there is light, leave.” 
29:11 So David rose up early, he and his men, leaving in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. Meanwhile, the Philistines went up to Jezreel. 
30:1 Now it came to pass, when David and his men returned to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid on the Negev and on Ziklag, and had attacked Ziklag and burned it with fire; 
30:2 taking the women in it captive, young and old, without killing anyone, but carried them off as they went their way. 
30:3 So when David and his men came to the town, behold, it was burned with fire—and their wives, their sons and their daughters had been taken captives. 
30:4 Then David and the troops with him lifted up their voice and wept until they there was no more strength in them to weep. 
30:5 Even David’s two wives were taken captive—Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal’s widow. 
30:6 So David was in a serious bind, for the troops were calling for his stoning, for all the troops were bitter of soul, every man for his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:7 Then David said to Abiathar the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
30:8 David inquired of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:9 So David went, he and the 600 men with him, and came to the Wadi Besor, where those left behind remained—
30:10 for 200 men stayed behind because they were too exhausted to cross Wadi Besor. Yet David pursued, he and the other 400 men. 
30:11 Then they found an Egyptian in the open field and brought him to David, gave him bread to eat and water to drink, 
30:12 and they also gave him a piece of fig cake and two cakes of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit came back to him, for he had eaten no bread and drunk no water for three days and three nights. 
30:13 Then David asked him, “To whom do you belong? Where are you from?” “I am a young Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite,” he said. “My master abandoned me three days ago because I fell sick. 
30:14 We made a raid in the Negev of the Cherethites, and on Judah, and on the Negev of Caleb; also we burned Ziklag with fire.” 
30:15 Then David asked him, “Will you lead me to this raiding band?” “Swear to me by God that you won’t kill me or deliver me into my master’s hands,” he said, “and I will lead you to this marauding band.” 
30:16 So he led him down, and behold, they were scattered over all the area, eating, drinking and feasting because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah. 
30:17 David attacked them from the twilight until the evening of the next day. None of them escaped, except 400 young men who rode on camels and fled. 
30:18 So David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and rescued his two wives. 
30:19 There was nothing of theirs missing, whether young or old, sons or daughters, spoils or anything else that had been carried off—David recovered everything. 
30:20 David took all the flocks and the herd that they had driven ahead of the other cattle, so they said, “This is David’s spoil.” 
30:21 When David reached the 200 men—who had been too exhausted to follow David and were left at Wadi Besor—they came out to meet David and to meet the men with him, so David approached these people and greeted them. 
30:22 But all the wicked men and worthless fellows among those who accompanied David said, “Because they did not accompany us, we shouldn’t give them any of the spoil that we’ve recovered, except every man may take his wife and his children and leave.” 
30:23 “You must not do so, my brothers with what </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:24 Who would listen to you in this matter? The share of him who went down to the battle is to be the same as that of him who remained by the baggage. They will share alike.” 
30:25 So it has been from that day forward—he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day. 
30:26 When David arrived at Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, “Look, a blessing for you from the spoil of the enemies of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:27 to those in Beth-el, Ramoth-Negev, Jattir, 
30:28 Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 
30:29 Racal, to those in the towns of Jerahmeelite, to those in the towns of the Kenites, 
30:30 Hormah, Bor-ashan, Athach, 
30:31 Hebron and to all the places where David and his men had roamed.
31:1 Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel. Israel’s men fled before the Philistines and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa. 
31:2 The Philistines pressed hard after Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan, Abinadab and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. 
31:3 When the battle intensified against Saul, the archers hit him, so he was severely wounded by the archers. 
31:4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, or else these uncircumcised will come and thrust me through after torturing me.” But his armor-bearer refused, for he was too afraid. So Saul took the sword and fell on it. 
31:5 When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword and died with him. 
31:6 So Saul, his three sons, his armor-bearer, and all his men died together that same day. 
31:7 When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those across the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the towns and fled. Then the Philistines came and occupied them. 
31:8 It was the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
31:9 So they cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and sent them throughout the land of the Philistines, to spread the good news to the house of their idols and to the people. 
31:10 Then they put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth and fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. 
31:11 Now when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
31:12 all their valiant men set out and walked all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, then went to Jabesh and burned them there. 
31:13 They took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh and fasted for seven days.
