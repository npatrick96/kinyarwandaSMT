1:1 Now Solomon the son of David firmly established himself over his kingdom. For </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:2 Solomon spoke to all Israel—t0 the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges and to every leader in all Israel, the leading patriarchs—
1:3 and Solomon and the whole assembly with him went to the high place that was at Gibeon, for the Tent of Meeting of God was there, which Moses the servant of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:4 Now David had brought up the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem. 
1:5 But the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur had made was there in front of the Tabernacle of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:6 So Solomon went up before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:7 That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask! What should I give you?” 
1:8 Solomon answered God, “You have shown great lovingkindness to my father David and now You have made me king in his place. 
1:9 Now, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:10 Now give me wisdom and knowledge that I may go out and come in before this people. For who can govern this great people of Yours?” 
1:11 Then God said to Solomon, “Since this was in your heart and you have not asked for riches, possessions or honor, nor for the life of those who hate you and have not even asked for long life but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself—so you can govern My people over whom I have made you king—
1:12 wisdom and knowledge will be given to you. Moreover, I will give you riches, possessions and honor, such as none of the kings who were before you ever had and none after you will have.” 
1:13 Then Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place that was at Gibeon, from in front of the Tent of Meeting. So he reigned over Israel. 
1:14 Solomon accumulated chariots and horsemen. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, which he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. 
1:15 The king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars as plentiful as sycamores in the foothills. 
1:16 Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Keve—the king’s merchants purchased them from Keve at a price. 
1:17 They imported a chariot from Egypt for 600 talents of silver and a horse for 150. So by the same means they were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.
2:1 Solomon recruited 70,000 men as carriers, 80,000 as stonecutters in the mountains and 3,600 supervisors over them. 
2:2 Then Solomon sent word to Huram the king of Tyre saying, “Deal with me as you did with my father David when you sent him cedars to build a house to dwell in. 
2:3 Behold, I am about to build a House for the Name of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:4 “The House that I am about to build will be great, because our God is greater than all the gods. 
2:5 But who is able to build Him a House, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain Him? Who then am I that I should build Him a House—except to burn incense before Him? 
2:6 “So now, send me a man skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, and in purple, crimson and blue yarn, and experienced in engraving, to work in Judah and Jerusalem with the skilled men who are with me, whom my father David provided. 
2:7 Send me also cedar, evergreen and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants are skilled in cutting timber in Lebanon. Indeed my servants will work with yours 
2:8 to prepare an abundance of timber for me, because the House that I am about to build will be large and magnificent. 
2:9 Now, behold, I will give to your servants, the woodsmen who cut the timber, 20,000 measures of ground wheat, 20,000 measures of barley, 20,000 vats of wine and 20,000 vats of oil.” 
2:10 Then King Huram of Tyre, replied in a letter that he sent to Solomon, “Because </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:11 Then Huram continued, “Blessed be </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:12 So now I am sending Huram-abi—a skilled man endowed with understanding 
2:13 who is the son of a woman from the daughters of Dan and whose father was a man from Tyre—a man skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, in purple and blue, fine linen and crimson, and to engrave all kinds of engraving, and who can execute any design given to him. He will work with your skilled men and with the skilled men of my lord David your father. 
2:14 Now let my lord send to his servants the wheat and barley, the oil and wine he has promised 
2:15 and we will cut as many logs from Lebanon as much as you need, and float them in rafts by sea to Jaffa. You can then take them up to Jerusalem.” 
2:16 Solomon counted all the foreign men in the land of Israel, like the census that his father David had taken, and 153,600 were found. 
2:17 He appointed 70,000 of them to carry loads, 80,000 to quarry stones in the mountains, and 3,600 overseers to supervise the people working. 
2:18
3:1 Then Solomon began to build the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:2 He began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign. 
3:3 Now the foundation Solomon laid for the building of the House of God was 60 cubits long and 20 cubits wide, according to the old standard. 
3:4 The porch in front of the House along its width was 20 cubits and its height was 120 cubits, and the inside was overlaid with pure gold. 
3:5 He paneled the main hall with cypress wood, which he overlaid with fine gold and embossed on it palm trees and chains. 
3:6 He adorned the House with precious stones and the gold he used was gold from Parvaim. 
3:7 Furthermore He overlaid the beams, thresholds, walls and doors of the House with gold and carved </span><span class="it"><span class="content">cheruvim
3:8 He made the Holy of Holies, its length corresponding to the width of the House—20 cubits long and 20 cubits wide. He overlaid it with 600 talents of fine gold. 
3:9 The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold. 
3:10 Next he made two sculptured </span><span class="it"><span class="content">cheruvim
3:11 The wingspan of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">cheruvim
3:12 Similarly, one wing of the second </span><span class="it"><span class="content">cheruv
3:13 Thus the wingspan of these </span><span class="it"><span class="content">cheruvim
3:14 Furthermore, he made the veil of blue, purple, crimson yarn and fine linen with </span><span class="it"><span class="content">cheruvim
3:15 In the front of the House he made two pillars 35 cubits high, each with a capital on the top measuring five cubits. 
3:16 He made interwoven chains for the inner Sanctuary and put them on top of the pillars. He also made 100 pomegranates and attached them to the chains. 
3:17 He erected the pillars in front of the Temple, one to the south and the other to the north. The one to the south he named Jachin and the one to the north Boaz. 
4:1 Moreover, he made a bronze altar 20 cubits long, 20 cubits wide and ten cubits high. 
4:2 He also made the Sea of cast metal ten cubits across from brim to brim, perfectly round. It was five cubits high and its circumference was 30 cubits. 
4:3 Beneath it, figures like bulls were set all around it, ten cubits encircling the Sea. The bulls were in two rows, cast in one piece with it. 
4:4 The Sea stood on 12 bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The Sea rested upon them and their hindquarters were all turned inward. 
4:5 It was a handbreadth thick, and the brim was like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held 3,000 vats. 
4:6 He also made ten basins for washing and placed five on the right side and five on the left. In them the items used for the burnt offering were rinsed, but the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
4:7 Next he made the ten </span><span class="it"><span class="content">menorot
4:8 He also made ten tables and placed them in the Temple, five on the right side and five on the left. He also made 100 gold bowls. 
4:9 Then he made the courtyard of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
4:10 He set the Sea on the south side at the southeast corner. 
4:11 Huram also made the pots, the shovels and the bowls. So Huram-abi finished the work that he had undertaken for King Solomon in the House of God: 
4:12 the two pillars, the bowls and the two capitals on the top of the pillars, and the two lattice-works to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars, 
4:13 and the 400 pomegranates for the two lattice-works (two rows of pomegranates for each lattice-work to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars). 
4:14 He also made the stands, the basins upon the stands, 
4:15 and the one Sea with the 12 bulls under it, 
4:16 as well as the pots, the shovels and the meat hooks. All the utensils Huram-abi made for King Solomon for the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:17 The king had them cast with clay earth from the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zeredah. 
4:18 Solomon made all these utensils in such great quantities that the weight of the bronze could not be determined. 
4:19 Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in the House of God, including the golden altar, the tables on which was the Bread of Presence, 
4:20 the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">menorot
4:21 with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold, the purest gold, 
4:22 and the snuffers, the bowls, the spoons and the fire-pans of pure gold, and the doors of the House—the inner doors for the Holy of Holies and the doors of the House, that is, the Temple—were of gold. 
5:1 When all the work that Solomon undertook for the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:2 Then Solomon gathered to Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the patriarchal leaders of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
5:3 All the men of Israel gathered together to the king at the feast that is in the seventh month. 
5:4 So all the elders of Israel came and the Levites took up the Ark 
5:5 and brought up the Ark and the Tent of Meeting along with all the sacred furnishings that were in the Tent. The Levitical </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
5:6 Meanwhile, King Solomon and the entire congregation of Israel who gathered with him before the Ark, were sacrificing so many sheep and bulls that they could not be counted or numbered. 
5:7 The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
5:8 The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">cheruvim
5:9 Now the poles were so long that the ends of the poles extending from the Ark could be seen in front of the inner Sanctuary, though they could not be seen from outside; and they are there to this day. 
5:10 There was nothing in the Ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed there at Horeb, where </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:11 And it came to pass, when the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
5:12 all the Levite singers—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, their sons and their relatives—dressed in fine linen with cymbals, harps and lyres, were standing at the east end of the altar and with them were 120 </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
5:13 Then it came to pass that when the trumpeters and singers joined as one to extol and praise </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:14 The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
6:1 Then Solomon declared, “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:2 I have built You a magnificent House and a place for You to dwell forever.” 
6:3 Then, while all the congregation of Israel was standing the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation of Israel. 
6:4 He said: “Blessed be </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:5 ‘Since the day that I brought My people out of the land of Egypt, I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a House that My Name might be there. Nor did I choose any man to be a leader over My people Israel. 
6:6 But I have chosen Jerusalem that My Name would abide there and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.’ 
6:7 “Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a House for the Name of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:8 But </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:9 Nevertheless, you will not build the House. Rather your son who will be born to you, he will build the House for My Name.’ 
6:10 “Now </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:11 There have I set the Ark in which is the Covenant of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:12 Then he stood before the altar of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:13 For Solomon had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide and three cubits high and placed it in the midst of the court. He stood on it and knelt down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven 
6:14 and he said, “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:15 You have kept the promise You made to Your servant David, my father. Surely you spoke with Your mouth and have fulfilled it with Your hand—as it is today. 
6:16 “Now therefore, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:17 “Now therefore, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:18 “But will God indeed dwell with mankind on the earth? Behold—heaven even the highest heaven—cannot contain You. How much less this House that I have built! 
6:19 Yet attend to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplication, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:20 that Your eyes may be open toward this House day and night, toward the place where You have said You would put Your Name there, to listen to the prayer which Your servant will pray toward this place. 
6:21 Hear the supplications of Your servant and Your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from Your dwelling place, from heaven, and when You hear, forgive. 
6:22 “If a man sins against his neighbor and is required to swear an oath, and he comes and takes an oath before Your altar in this House, 
6:23 then hear from heaven and act. Judge Your servants, repaying the wicked by bringing down on his own head what he has done and vindicating the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness. 
6:24 “If Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, yet when they return and confess Your Name, praying and making supplication before You in this House, 
6:25 then hear from heaven, forgive the sin of Your people Israel and bring them back to the land which You gave to them and to their fathers. 
6:26 “When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, if they pray toward this place and confess Your Name, turning from their sin because You afflicted them, 
6:27 then may You hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel. Indeed may You teach them the good way in which they should walk. Send rain upon Your land that You have given to Your people for an inheritance. 
6:28 “When there is famine in the land, when there is pestilence, blight, mildew, locust or grasshopper, when their enemies besiege them in the land by their gates, whatever plague or sickness may come, 
6:29 and any prayer or plea is offered by any individual or by all Your people Israel—each acknowledging his own afflictions and pain, even spreading his hands toward this House—
6:30 then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place and forgive. May You give to every man according to all his ways, as You know his heart—for You alone know the hearts of the children of men—
6:31 so that they will fear You and walk in Your ways all the days that they live in the land that You gave to our fathers. 
6:32 “Moreover, concerning the foreigner who is not of Your people Israel but comes from a distant land for the sake of Your great Name and Your mighty hand and Your outstretched arm, when they come and pray toward this House, 
6:33 then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place and do whatever the foreigner asks of You. Then all the peoples of the earth will acknowledge Your Name and revere You, as Your people Israel do, and they will know that this House which I have built is called by Your Name. 
6:34 “When Your people go out to battle against their enemies, wherever You send them, and they pray to You toward this city that You have chosen and the House that I have built for Your Name, 
6:35 then hear from heaven their prayer and their petition, and uphold their cause. 
6:36 When they sin against You—for there is no man that does not sin —and You become angry with them and hand them over to the enemy who takes them captive to a land far off or near, 
6:37 when they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive, and they repent and seek You in the land of their captivity saying, ‘We have sinned, we have committed inquity, we have acted wickedly,’ 
6:38 “and they return to You with all their heart and soul in the land of their captivity where they were taken captive, and they pray toward their land which You gave to their fathers and the city which You have chosen and toward the House which I have built for Your Name, 
6:39 then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, their prayer and their petitions and uphold their cause, and forgive Your people who have sinned against You. 
6:40 “Now my God, I pray, let Your eyes be open, and let Your ears be attentive to the prayer made in this place. 
6:41 Now arise, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:42 , do not reject Your anointed one. Remember the loyalty of Your servant David.”
7:1 Now when Solomon finished praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:2 The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
7:3 When all </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
7:4 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:5 King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the House of God. 
7:6 The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
7:7 Moreover, Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard that was before the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:8 At that time, Solomon observed the feast for seven days and all Israel with him—a very great assembly from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt. 
7:9 On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the feast for seven days. 
7:10 On the 23rd day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:11 Thus Solomon finished the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:12 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:13 If I shut up heaven that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among My people, 
7:14 when My people, 0ver whom My Name is called, humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their evil ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land. 
7:15 Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place.
7:16 For now I have chosen and consecrated this House so that My Name may be there forever. My eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually. 
7:17 “As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, doing all that I have commanded you, keeping My statutes and My ordinances, 
7:18 then I will establish your royal throne as I covenanted with your father David saying, ‘You shall not lack a man to be ruler in Israel.’ 
7:19 But if you turn away and forsake My decrees and My </span><span class="it"><span class="content">mitzvot
7:20 then I will uproot them from My land which I gave them, and this House which I have consecrated for My Name I will cast out of My sight. I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. 
7:21 As for this House, which is so exalted, every one passing by it shall be appalled and say, ‘Why has </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:22 And they will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:1 It came to pass at the end of 20 years, during which Solomon built the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:2 that he built the cities which Huram had given to him and settled </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
8:3 Then Solomon marched against Hamath-zobah and overpowered it. 
8:4 He built up Tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities that he built in Hamath. 
8:5 He also built upper Beth-horon and lower Bet-horon as fortified cities with walls, gates and bars, 
8:6 as well as Baalath and all his store cities, and cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen—every thing that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land that he ruled. 
8:7 All the people that were left of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, who were not of Israel, 
8:8 that is, those of their descendants that were left after them in the land, whom </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
8:9 But Solomon did not make slaves of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
8:10 These were the chief officers of King Solomon, 250 who ruled over the people. 
8:11 Solomon brought Pharaoh’s daughter up from the city of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not dwell in the palace of King David of Israel, because the places where the Ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:12 At that time, Solomon offered burnt offerings to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:13 according to the daily requirement for offerings commanded by Moses for </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Shabbatot
8:14 Following the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
8:15 They did not depart from the king’s commandment to the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
8:16 Thus all Solomon’s work was carried out from the day of the foundation of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:17 Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Elat on the coast of the land of Edom. 
8:18 And Huram sent him ships commanded by his servants and servants that knew the sea. They went with Solomon’s servants to Ophir and obtained from there 450 talents of gold and brought them to King Solomon.
9:1 When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon’s fame, she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with hard questions. Accompanied by a large caravan train, including camels carrying an abundance of spices and gold, and precious stones, she came to Solomon and spoke with him about all that was in her heart. 
9:2 Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was hidden from Solomon which he did not explain to her. 
9:3 When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the palace he had built, 
9:4 as well as the food on his table, the seating of his courtiers, the service and attire of his attendants, his cupbearers and their attire, and his procession with which he went up to the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
9:5 She said to the king: “The report that I heard in my own land about your achievements and your wisdom is true. 
9:6 But I did not believe their reports until I came and saw with my own eyes. And behold, not even half of the greatness of your wisdom was described to me—you surpass the report that I heard! 
9:7 How blessed are your men, how blessed are your courtiers who continually stand in your presence and hear your wisdom. 
9:8 Blessed be </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
9:9 Then she gave the king 120 gold talents, large quantities of spices and precious stones. There had never been such quantities of spices as the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. 
9:10 The servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir also brought algumwood and precious stones. 
9:11 From the sandalwood the king made ramps for the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
9:12 King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for—more than what she had brought to the king. Then she with her courtiers, returned, going back to her own land. 
9:13 Now the weight of gold that Solomon received in one year was 666 gold talents, 
9:14 besides what the traders and merchants brought and the gold and silver that all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the region brought to Solomon. 
9:15 King Solomon made 200 shields of beaten gold, 600 shekels of beaten gold for each shield, 
9:16 and also 300 shields of beaten gold, 300 shekels of gold for each shield. The king put them in the palace of the Lebanon Forest. 
9:17 Furthermore, the king made a large ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold. 
9:18 The throne had six steps and a golden footstool attached to it, and arms on each side of the seat. Two lions stood beside the arms 
9:19 and 12 lions stood on the six steps, one at each end of each step. None like it was ever made for any kingdom. 
9:20 All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the palace of the Lebanon Forest were of pure gold—silver was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon. 
9:21 Because the king’s ships sailed to Tarshish with Huram’s servants once every three years, the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes and peacocks. 
9:22 So King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
9:23 And all the kings of the earth sought an audience with Solomon to listen to the wisdom that God had put in his heart. 
9:24 Everyone brought his tribute—vessels of silver, vessels of gold, garments, armor, spices, horses and mules—in the due amount each year. 
9:25 Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horsemen that he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem. 
9:26 And he ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, and as far as the border of Egypt. 
9:27 The king made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars as plentiful as the sycamore trees that are in the foothills. 
9:28 Horses were brought for Solomon from Egypt and from all countries. 
9:29 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, the beginning and the end, are they not written in the chronicles of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Jedo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? 
9:30 Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel 40 years. 
9:31 Then Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David, and Rehoboam his son became king in his place. 
10:1 Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 
10:2 Now it came to pass that when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard this—for he was in Egypt where he had fled from King Solomon—Jeroboam returned from Egypt. 
10:3 So they sent and summoned him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came to Rehoboam and spoke to Rehoboam saying, 
10:4 “Your father made our yoke grievous but now lighten the harsh labor of your father and his heavy yoke that he put on us—then we will serve you.” 
10:5 He answered them, “Come back to me in three days.” So the people departed. 
10:6 Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was alive, saying, “How do you advise me to answer this people?” 
10:7 They answered him saying, “If you will be kind to this people and please them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.” 
10:8 But he disregarded the counsel that the elders had given him and consulted with the young men who grew up with him and served him. 
10:9 He said to them, “How do you advise me to answer this people who have spoken to me saying, ‘Lighten the yoke that your father put on us?’” 
10:10 The young men that grew up with him answered him saying: “Speak thus to the people who spoke to you saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, now you make it lighter for us’. Thus shall you say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins. 
10:11 Now, whereas my father laid a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will do so with scorpions.’” 
10:12 Then Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had said to them saying, “Come back to me on the third day.” 
10:13 The king answered them harshly. King Rehoboam ignored the counsel of the elders 
10:14 and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men saying, “I will make your yoke heavy—I will make it even heavier. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scorpions.” 
10:15 So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from God so that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:16 When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king saying, “What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse! To your tents, O Israel! Now look after your own house, David!” So all Israel departed to their tents. 
10:17 But Rehoboam continued to reign over </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
10:18 Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the forced labor, but men of Israel pelted him to death with stones. King Rehoboam, however, managed to mount his chariot and to flee to Jerusalem. 
10:19 So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
11:1 Now when Rehoboam arrived at Jerusalem, he assembled the House of Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 chosen men who were warriors, to fight against Israel in order to restore the kingdom back to Rehoboam. 
11:2 But the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:3 “Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin saying, 
11:4 ‘Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:5 Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built fortified cities for defense in Judah. 
11:6 He built up Beth-lehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
11:7 Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, 
11:8 Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
11:9 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
11:10 Zorah, Aijalon and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and in Benjamin. 
11:11 He also strengthened the fortified towns and put commanders in them, along with stores of food, oil and wine. 
11:12 He also put shields and spears in every town, and made them very strong. So he held Judah and Benjamin. 
11:13 Moreover, the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
11:14 The Levites even abandoned their pastures and their possessions and came to Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
11:15 and had appointed his own priests for the high places, for the he-goats and for the calves that he had made. 
11:16 Those from all the tribes of Israel, who had set their hearts to seek </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:17 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam the son of Solomon for three years, for they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years. 
11:18 Rehoboam married Mahalat the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse. 
11:19 She bore him sons: Jeush and Shemariah and Zaham. 
11:20 After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza and Shelomith. 
11:21 Now Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom more than all his wives and concubines—for he took 18 wives and 60 concubines and fathered 28 sons and 60 daughters. 
11:22 Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as chief and commander among his brothers, for he intended to make him king. 
11:23 He also wisely dispersed some of his sons throughout the territories of Judah and Benjamin to all the fortified cities and he gave them plenty of food and sought many wives for them.
12:1 Now it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established and he had become strong, that he and all Israel with him forsook the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
12:2 It so happened that in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, King Shishak of Egypt marched against Jerusalem—because they had been unfaithful to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:3 with 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen and innumerable troops that came with him from Egypt: Lybians, Sukkites and Cushites. 
12:4 He captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem. 
12:5 Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the officers of Judah who had gathered in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:6 Then the officers of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:7 But when </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:8 However, they will become subjects to him so that they may learn the difference between serving Me and serving the kings of the earth.” 
12:9 So Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:10 So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and entrusted them to the hands of the captains of the royal guard that guarded the entrance to the royal palace. 
12:11 Whenever the king entered into the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:12 Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the anger of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:13 So King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned as king. Rehoboam was 41 years old when he began to reign and he reigned 17 years in Jerusalem—the city that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:14 But he did evil because he had not set his heart to seek </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:15 Now the acts of Rehoboam, from beginning to end, are they not written in the chronicles of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer for genealogies? There were continuous wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. 
12:16 Then Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. Then his son Abijah became king in his place.
13:1 In the 18th year of King Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah. 
13:2 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Micaiah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
13:3 Abijah went into battle with an army of valiant warriors, 400,000 chosen men, while Jeroboam arranged for battle against him 800,000 chosen men, mighty warriors. 
13:4 Abijah stood on top of Mount Zemaraim, which is a hill of Ephraim, and said, “Listen to me Jeroboam and all Israel! 
13:5 Don’t you know that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:6 Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master. 
13:7 Riffraff and scoundrels gathered around him and pressed hard on Rehoboam son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not stand up to them. 
13:8 “So now, do you intend to oppose the kingdom of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:9 Have you not banished the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
13:10 “But as for us, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:11 Every morning and evening they burn to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:12 So look, God is with us at our head, and His </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
13:13 But Jeroboam had commanded the ambush to go around and come from the rear. So while they were in front of Judah, the ambush was behind them. 
13:14 When Judah turned around, behold, the battle was before and behind them. They cried out to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:15 Then the men of Judah raised a battle cry, and as the men of Judah shouted, God struck down Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 
13:16 Then men of Israel fled before Judah and God delivered them into their hand. 
13:17 So Abijah and his people defeated them with a great slaughter, and 500,000 chosen men of Israel fell slain. 
13:18 Thus men of Israel were subdued at that time, while the children of Judah prevailed—because they relied upon </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:19 Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured towns from him: Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephron with its villages. 
13:20 Jeroboam could not muster strength again in the days of Abijah. Finally </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:21 But Abijah grew powerful and took to himself 14 wives and fathered 22 sons and 16 daughters. 
13:22 Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways and his sayings, are written in the chronicles of the prophet Iddo. 
14:1 Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:2 He removed the foreign altars and the high places, smashed the pillars and cut down the Asherah poles. 
14:3 He commanded Judah to seek </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:4 He also removed the high places and the incense stands out of all the cities of Judah. So the kingdom remained untroubled under him. 
14:5 He built up fortified cities in Judah, for the land was untroubled and he was not engaged in warfare during those years because </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:6 Then he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars, while the land is still ours because we have sought </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:7 Now Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah who bore shields and spears and 280,000 from Benjamin who bore shields and drew bows. All of these were valiant warriors. 
14:8 Then Zerah the Cushite marched against them with an army of a million men and 300 chariots. When he arrived at Mareshah, 
14:9 Asa went out to meet him and they arrayed for battle in the valley of Zephath at Mareshah. 
14:10 Then Asa cried to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:11 So </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:12 and Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar. So many of the Cushites fell that they could not recover because they were shattered before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:13 They destroyed all the cities around Gerar, for the terror from </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:14 They also attacked the tents of herdsmen and carried off many sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
14:15
15:1 The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach Elohim
15:2 He went out to meet Asa, and said to him, “Listen to me Asa, all Judah and Benjamin. </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:3 For many days Israel was without the true God, without a teaching </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
15:4 But in their distress they turned to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:5 In those times there was no </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom
15:6 Nation was crushed by nation and city by city, for God troubled them with every kind of distress. 
15:7 But you, </span><span class="it"><span class="content">chazak
15:8 When Asa heard these words as well as the prophecy of the prophet Oded, he took courage and removed the abominations from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the towns that he had seized in the hill country of Ephraim. He also repaired </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:9 He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, as well as those dwelling with them from Ephraim, Manasseh and Simeon—for many had defected to him from Israel when they saw that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:10 So they assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. 
15:11 On that day they sacrificed to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:12 They entered into a covenant to seek </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:13 Whoever would not seek </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:14 They also made an oath to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:15 All Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought Him with all their will and He was found by them. Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:16 He also deposed Maacah, the mother of King Asa, from being queen because she had made an abominable image for Asherah. Asa cut down her abominable image, crushed it and burned it in the Kidron Valley. 
15:17 Though the high places were not removed from Israel, still Asa’s heart was completely committed to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:18 He brought into the House of God his father’s consecrated articles, as well as his consecrated articles of silver and gold, and utensils. 
15:19 So there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
16:1 In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, King Baasa of Israel marched against Judah and fortified Ramah in order to prevent anyone from leaving or coming to King Asa of Judah. 
16:2 In response, Asa brought out silver and gold from the treasuries of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:3 “Let there be a covenant between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. Look, I have sent you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with King Baasha of Israel so that he may withdraw from me.” 
16:4 So Ben-hadad consented to King Asa’s request and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel. They ravaged Ijon, Dan, Abelmaim and all the storage cities of Naphtali. 
16:5 When Baasa heard, he stopped building Ramah and stopped his work. 
16:6 Then King Asa took up all of Judah to carry away the stones of Ramah and the timber with which Baasa had been building—with them he fortified Geba and Mizpah. 
16:7 At that time the seer Hanani came to King Asa of Judah and said to him: “Because you have depended on the king of Aram, and not depended on </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:8 Were not the Cushites and the Libyans a mighty army with many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:9 For the eyes of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:10 Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in the prison for he was enraged at him for this. Also Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time. 
16:11 Behold, the acts of Asa, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 
16:12 Now in the thirty-nineth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet. His illness was severe, yet even in his disease he did not seek </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:13 Finally Asa slept with his fathers, dying in the forty-first year of his reign. 
16:14 He was buried in his own tomb, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David. They laid him in his resting place, which was filled with sweet spices and various blended perfumes and they made a very large fire for him. 
17:1 Jehoshaphat his son became king in his place and took firm hold of his position against Israel. 
17:2 He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and set garrisons throughout the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured. 
17:3  was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the first ways of his father David. He did not seek the Baalim 
17:4 but sought the God of his father, and walked in His </span><span class="it"><span class="content">mitzvot
17:5 So </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:6 His heart was devoted to the ways of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:7 Then in the third year of his reign he sent his officials—Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah—to teach in the towns of Judah. 
17:8 With them were the Levites Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tob-adonijah and with them Elishama and Jehoram the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
17:9 They taught throughout Judah, having with them a </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
17:10 Now the fear of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:11 Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute. The Arabs also brought him flocks—7,700 rams and 7,700 he-goats. 
17:12 So Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful. He built forts and storage cities in Judah 
17:13 and carried out extensive work in the cities of Judah. He had men of war, valiant warriors, in Jerusalem. 
17:14 These were their appointees according to their clans. From Judah, captains of thousands: Adnah the commander with 300,000 valiant warriors; 
17:15 and next to him Jehohanan the commander with 280,000; 
17:16 and next to him, Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:17 From Benjamin: Eliada a valiant warrior with 200,000 men armed with bow and shield; 
17:18 and next to him Jehozabad with 180,000 equipped for war. 
17:19 These were the men who served the king besides those whom the king stationed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
18:1 Now Jehoshaphat had wealth and honor in abundance but he allied himself with Ahab by marriage. 
18:2 Some years later he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and bulls for him and the people with him, and urged him to march with him against Ramoth-gilead. 
18:3 King Ahab of Israel asked King Jehoshaphat of Judah, “Will you go with me against Ramoth-gilead?” He replied, “I am as you are and my people as your people, and we will be with you in battle.” 
18:4 Jehoshaphat then said to the king of Israel, “Please, let us seek, today, the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:5 So the king of Israel assembled the prophets—400 men—and asked them, “Should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I hold off?” They answered, “Go up, for God will give it into the king’s hand!” 
18:6 But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn’t there another prophet of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:7 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man through whom we can inquire of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:8 So the king of Israel called an official and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah quickly!” 
18:9 Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah, wearing their robes, were sitting on their thrones on the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria with all the prophets prophesying before them. 
18:10 Zedekiah son of Henaanah made for himself iron horns and declared, “Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:11 All the other prophets were prophesying similarly, saying “March against Ramoth-gilead and succeed, for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:12 Now the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah spoke to him saying, “Look, the words of the prophets are unanimously favorable to the king. So please let your word be like one of them and speak favorably.” 
18:13 But Micaiah replied, “As </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:14 When he came to the king, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I hold off?” He replied, “March and be victorious! They will be given into your hand!” 
18:15 But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the Name of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:16  So he said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:17 So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he never prophesies good about me, only evil?” 
18:18 Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:19 And </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:20 until a spirit came forward and stood before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:21 He answered, ‘I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ Then He said, ‘You will entice him and you will also succeed. Go and do so.’ 
18:22 So now, behold, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:23 Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah approached Micaiah, slapped him on the cheek and said, “How did the spirit of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:24 Micaiah replied, “Behold, you will see on the day that you go to hide in an inner room.” 
18:25 Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and turn him over to Amon, governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son, 
18:26 and say, ‘Thus says the king, “Put this fellow in prison and make him eat the bread and water of affliction—until I return in </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom
18:27 Then Micaiah said, “If you ever return in </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom
18:28 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah marched against Ramoth-gilead. 
18:29 Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into the battle, but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and they went into the battle. 
18:30 Now the king of Aram had already ordered his chariot commanders saying: “Don’t attack anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel alone.” 
18:31 So when the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat they thought, “This is the king of Israel.” So they turned to attack him but Jehoshaphat cried out. </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:32 When the chariot commanders realized that he was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. 
18:33 But a man drew his bow aimlessly and struck the king of Israel between the lower armor and the breastplate. The king said to the charioteer, “Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am wounded.” 
18:34 The battle raged that day and the king of Israel remained propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans until dusk. Then at sunset he died.
19:1 Then King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem. 
19:2 Jehu son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:3 Nevertheless, good things are found in you, for you have removed the Asherah poles out of the land and have set your heart to seek God.” 
19:4 Jehoshaphat dwelt in Jerusalem and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba over to the hill country of Ephraim and brought them back to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:5 He also appointed judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city. 
19:6 He said to the judges. “Consider what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:7 Now then, let the fear of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:8 In Jerusalem also, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites, </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
19:9 He charged them saying, “This is how you shall act: in the fear of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:10 When any dispute comes to you from your kinsmen who live in their cities, whether bloodshed, or concerning </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
19:11 “Behold, Amariah the chief </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
20:1 Now it happened after this that the Moabites and the Ammonites together with other Ammonites came to make war against Jehoshaphat. 
20:2 Some came and reported to Jehoshaphat saying, “A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, from Aram, and are already in Hazazon-Tamar” (that is En-Gedi). 
20:3 Jehoshaphat was afraid so he resolved to seek </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:4 Judah assembled to seek help from </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:5 Then Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:6 and said: “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:7 Are You not our God who drove out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel and gave it to the descendants of Your friend Abraham forever? 
20:8 They settled in it and built You a Temple there for Your Name saying, 
20:9 ‘If calamity comes upon us—the sword of judgment, pestilence or famine—we will stand before this House and before You—for Your Name is in this House—and cry to You in our distress and You will hear and deliver us.’ 
20:10 “Now behold, the sons of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir—whose land You did not allow Israel to invade when they came from the land of Egypt, instead they turned aside from them and did not destroy them—
20:11 now behold, how they repay us by coming to drive us out of Your possession that You gave us as an inheritance. 
20:12 Our God, will You not execute judgment on them? For we have no power to face this great multitude that is attacking us. We do not know what to do—but our eyes are on You.” 
20:13 All Judah was standing before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:14 Then in the midst of the congregation, the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
20:15 and he said: “Listen all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat. Thus </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:16 Tomorrow go down against them as they come up the ascent of Ziz. You will find them at the end of the valley in front of the wilderness of Jeruel. 
20:17 You will not fight in this battle. Take your positions, stand and see the salvation of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:18 Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:19 Levites, from the sons of Kohath and the sons of Korah, stood up to praise </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:20 Early in the morning they arose and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa. As they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, O Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:21 After consulting with the people, he appointed singers to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:22 As they began singing and praising, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:23 For the Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to exterminate and annihilate them. When they had exterminated the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another. 
20:24 When Judah came to the lookout in the wilderness and looked for the multitude, behold, only corpses were lying on the ground—no one had escaped. 
20:25 When Jehoshaphat and his people went to take the plunder, they found an abundance of goods, clothing and precious articles, which they pillaged, more than they could carry away. For three days they were taking the plunder because there was so much. 
20:26 On the fourth day they assembled in the valley of Bracha where they blessed </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:27 Then every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat at their head, returned joyfully to Jerusalem for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:28 They came to Jerusalem to the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:29 So the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the region because they heard that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:30 So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was untroubled for his God gave him rest all around.
20:31 Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was 35 years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shlihi. 
20:32 He walked in the way of his father Asa and did not stray from it, doing what was right in the eyes of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:33 However, the high places were not removed, nor did the people direct their hearts to the God of their fathers. 
20:34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from beginning to end, behold, they are written in the annals of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is included in the book of the kings of Israel. 
20:35 Afterward, King Jehoshaphat of Judah allied himself with King Ahaziah of Israel, thereby acting wickedly. 
20:36 He joined with him to construct ships to go to Tarshish, and they constructed the ships in Ezion-geber. 
20:37 Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat saying, “Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:1 Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. Jehoram his son became king in his place. 
21:2 His brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael and Shephatiah—all these were the sons of King Jehoshaphat of Israel. 
21:3 Their father had given them great gifts of silver, gold and precious things, along with fortified cities in Judah, but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn. 
21:4 Now when Jehoram had risen over his father’s kingdom and made himself strong, he slew all his brothers with the sword, along with some of the officers of Israel. 
21:5 Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. 
21:6 He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab did (for Ahab’s daughter was his wife), and he did evil in the eyes of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:7 However, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:8 In his days Edom rebelled against Judah’s rule and set up a king over themselves. 
21:9 So Jehoram crossed over with his officers and all his chariots with him. He rose up by night and struck the Edomites who were surrounding him and the chariot commanders. 
21:10 Thus Edom has been in rebellion against Judah to this day. Then Libnah also revolted from under his hand at that time—because he had forsaken </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:11 Moreover, he built high places on the mountains of Judah and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot and led Judah astray.
21:12 A letter from Elijah the prophet came to him saying: “Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:13 but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, leading Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem into prostitution just as the house of Ahab committed prostitution and you have also slain your brothers—your own family, who were better than you—
21:14 behold, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:15 You yourself will be striken by multiple illnesses of your intestines, day after day, until your intestines drop out because of the illness.” 
21:16 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:17 They rose up against Judah, invaded it and carried away all the possessions found in the royal palace, as well as his sons and his wives. No son was left to him except Jehoahaz, his youngest. 
21:18 After all this, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:19 and it continued day after day for two years, so that at the end his bowels fell out because of his sickness and he died in great agonies. His people made no fire in his honor like the fire of his fathers. 
21:20 He was 32 years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years and he passed away, to no one’s regret. He was buried in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings. 
22:1 Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place for the troops that invaded the camp with the Arabians had slain all the older ones. Thus Ahaziah the son of Jehoram became king over Judah. 
22:2 Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri. 
22:3 He too walked in the ways of the house of Ahab for his mother counseled him to do evil. 
22:4 He did evil in the sight of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:5 He also followed their counsel when he went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to wage war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram, 
22:6 so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought Hazael king of Aram. Then Azariah, the son of Jehoram king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he had been wounded. 
22:7 Now through his coming to Joram, God brought about Ahaziah’s downfall. Upon his arrival, Ahaziah went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:8 So it came to pass that when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, he came upon the officers of Judah and Azaiah’s relatives, who had been attending Azaiah, and slew them. 
22:9 He then searched for Azaiah who was caught hiding in Samaria. Then they brought him to Jehu, put him to death and buried him, for they said, “He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:10 Now when Athaliah, Azaiah’s mother, saw that her son had died, she arose and destroyed all the royal offspring of the house of Judah. 
22:11 But Jehoshebeath, the king’s daughter, took Joash the son of Azaiah and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were being slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedroom. Because Jehoshebaeath, daughter of King Jehoram and wife of Jehoiada the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
22:12 He remained hidden with them in the House of God for six years while Athaliah reigned over the land.
23:1 Now in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself and brought the officers of hundreds—Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri—into a covenant with him. 
23:2 They went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah and the leading patriarchs of Israel. They came to Jerusalem 
23:3 and the entire congregation made a covenant with the king in the House of God. Then he said to them: “Behold, the king’s son! He must reign as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:4 This is what you should do: a third of you, </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
23:5 a third of you shall be in the royal palace, and a third at the Foundation Gate, and all the people shall be in the courtyard, and all the people should be in the courtyard of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:6 But let no one enter into the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:7 The Levites will surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand, and whoever enters the House, let him be killed. Stay close to the king in his comings and goings.” 
23:8 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
23:9 And Jehoiada the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
23:10 Then he stationed all the people, each man with his weapon in his hand around the king—from the south side of the House to the north side of the House by the altar and by the House. 
23:11 Then they brought out the king’s son and placed upon him the crown and the insignia. They proclaimed him king, and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and declared, “Long live the king!” 
23:12 When Athaliah heard the shouting of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people to the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:13 She looked, and behold, the king was standing by his pillar at the entrance and the officers and the trumpeters were beside the king. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing the trumpets, and the singers with their musical instruments were leading the praise. So Athaliah tore her clothes and said, “Treason, treason!” 
23:14 Jehoiada the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
23:15 So they seized her as she arrived at the entrance of the Horse Gate of the royal palace and killed her there. 
23:16 Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, all the people and the king to be the people of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:17 All the people went to the house of Baal and tore it down, smashed its altars and images into pieces, and slew Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars. 
23:18 Then Jehoiada placed the oversight of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:19 He also stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:20 He took the officers of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:21 and all the people of the land rejoiced. The city was quiet for Athaliah had been slain with the sword.
24:1 Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem 40 years. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. 
24:2 Joash did what was right in the eyes of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:3 Jehoiada took two wives by whom he fathered sons and daughters. 
24:4 It came to pass after this that Joash had a heart to renovate the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:5 He assembled the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
24:6 So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief and asked him, “Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:7 For the sons of wicked Athaliah had broken into the House of God, and had even used all the sacred things of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:8 So the king commanded that a box be made and placed outside the gate of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:9 A proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring in to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:10 All the officers and all the people rejoiced, and brought in and cast into the chest until it was full. 
24:11 Whenever the chest was brought by the Levites to the king’s officers and when they saw that it was full of money, the royal scribe and the officer of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen gadol
24:12 The king and Jehoiada gave it to workmen who carried out the work for the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:13 So the workmen labored and the renovation work progressed in their hands. They restored the House of God to its original design, and strengthened it. 
24:14 When they had finished, they brought the remainder of the money before the king and Jehoiada and they made it into vessels for the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:15 When Jehoiada reached a ripe old age, he died. He was 130 years old when he died. 
24:16 So he was buried in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good things in Israel and toward God and His House.
24:17 Now after the death of Jehoiada, the chiefs of Judah came and bowed down to the king. Then the king listened to them. 
24:18 They forsook the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:19  sent prophets to them to bring them back to Him and although they admonished them, they would not listen. 
24:20 Then the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach Elohim
24:21 But they conspired against him, and by order of the king, they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:22 Thus King Joash disregarded the loyalty which his father Jehoiada had shown to him—and slew Jehoiada’s son. As he was dying, he said: “May </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:23 It came to pass that at the turn of the year, the Aramean army came up against him. They invaded Judah and Jerusalem and massacred all the chieftains of the people, and sent all their plunder to the king of Damascus. 
24:24 Although the Aramean army came with only a small number of men, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:25 When they withdrew from him—for they left him very sick—his own servants plotted against him because of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
24:26 These men conspired against him: Zabad son of Shimiath the Ammonitess and Jehozabad son of Shimrith the Moabitess. 
24:27 Now concerning his sons and the many prophesies against him and the rebuilding of the House of God, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son became king in his place.
25:1 Amaziah was 25 years old when he became king and reigned 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan from Jerusalem. 
25:2 Now he did what was right in the eyes of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:3 Once he had the kingdom firmly secured under him, he executed his courtiers who had assassinated his father the king. 
25:4 He did not put their children to death, but acted according to what is written in the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
25:5 Amaziah gathered together the people of Judah and assigned them according to their clans to officers of thousands and officers of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He mustered those from 20 years old and upward, and found 300,000 chosen men, able to go to war, able to handle spear and shield. 
25:6 He also hired 100,000 valiant warriors from Israel for a hundred talents of silver. 
25:7 But a man of God came to him saying, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:8 For if you go and fight courageously in battle, God will overthrow you before the enemy, for God has power to help and to bring down.” 
25:9 But Amaziah said to the man of God, “And what is to be done about the 100 talents that I have given to the Israelite troops?” The man of God answered, “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:10 So, Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim to go back to their homes. Their anger burned greatly against Judah and they returned home in a rage. 
25:11 Amaziah then took courage and leading his army, marched to the Valley of Salt. He struck down 10,000 men of Seir. 
25:12 The army of Judah also captured 10,000 alive, and brought them to the top of the cliff. They threw them down from the top of the cliff and everyone fell to their death. 
25:13 Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had sent back and not allowed to go with him to battle raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth-Horon. They struck down 3,ooo of them and took considerable spoils.
25:14 Now after Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, he had the gods of the men of Seir brought and installed as his gods. He prostrated himself before them and burned incense to them. 
25:15 The anger of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:16 But while he was still speaking to him, the king said to him, “Have we appointed you a counselor to the king? Stop! Why should you be struck down?” So the prophet stopped after he said, “Now I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have acted this way and have not listened to my counsel.” 
25:17 Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent this message to Joash son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel saying, “Come, let us meet face to face.” 
25:18 Joash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah saying: “The thorn bush in Lebanon sent a message to the cedar in Lebanon saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ Then a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trambled the thorn bush. 
25:19 You say, ‘Behold, I have defeated Edom.’ So now your heart has become arrogant and proud. Stay home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah with you?” 
25:20 However, Amaziah would not listen, for it was from God in order that He might deliver them into the hand of Joash because they had sought the gods of Edom. 
25:21 So King Joash of Israel attacked. He and King Amaziah of Judah confronted one another at Beth-shemesh, which belonged to Judah. 
25:22 Then Judah was routed before Israel, and every man fled to his tent. 
25:23 King Joash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah—son of Joash, son of Jehoahaz—in Beth-shemesh. Then Joash brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim gate to the Corner Gate, 400 cubits. 
25:24 He took all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in the House of God with Obed-edom, together with the treasuries of the king’s palace and the hostages, and returned to Samaria. 
25:25 Amaziah the son of King Joash of Judah lived 15 years after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel. 
25:26 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, the first and the last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? 
25:27 From the time that Amaziah turned away from following </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:28 Then they brought him back on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
26:1 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was 16 years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah. 
26:2 He built Eloth and restored it to Judah after the king slept with his fathers. 
26:3 Uzziah was 16 years old when he became king, and he reigned 52 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecoliah from Jerusalem. 
26:4 He did what was right in the eyes of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:5 He continued to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding through the visions of God. As long as he sought </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:6 He went out and fought the Philistines and breached the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod. He built cities in Ashdod and among the Philistines. 
26:7 God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabs who dwelt in Gur-Baal, and against the Meunites. 
26:8 The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread abroad even to the border of Egypt, for he became exceedingly strong. 
26:9 Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate and at the Angle, and fortified them. 
26:10 He also built towers in the wilderness and dug out many cisterns because he had much livestock, and he had farmers in the foothills and in the plain and vinedressers in the mountains and in the fertile fields—for he loved the soil. 
26:11 Uzziah also had a well-trained army ready to go out to battle by divisions, according to the numbers mustered by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the official, under Hananiah, one of the king’s chieftains. 
26:12 The total number of family leaders over the fighting men was 2,600, 
26:13 and under their command was an army of 307,500 trained for war with mighty power to support the king against the enemy. 
26:14 Uzziah provided shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows and slingstones for the entire army. 
26:15 In Jerusalem he made machines designed by skillful men to be used on the towers and on the corners to shoot arrows and hurl large stones. So his fame spread far, for he was marvelously helped until he became strong.
26:16 But when he became strong, his heart grew so haughty that he acted corruptly. For he trespassed against </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:17 Then Azariah the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
26:18 They opposed Uzziah the king and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:19 Then Uzziah, who had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, became angry. While he was raging at the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
26:20 When Azariah the chief </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
26:21 King Uzziah had tza’arat until the day of his death. He lived in a separate house with </span><span class="it"><span class="content">tza'arat
26:22 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from beginning to end, were recorded by the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz. 
26:23 So Uzziah slept with his fathers and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial that belonged to the kings, for they said: “He had </span><span class="it"><span class="content">tza'arat
27:1 Jotham was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. 
27:2 He did what was right in the eyes of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
27:3 He rebuilt the upper gate of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
27:4 He also built towns in the Judean hills and forts and towers in the forests. 
27:5 Jotham also fought the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. That year the Ammonites paid him 100 talents of silver, 10,000 measures of wheat and 10,000 of barley. The Ammonites brought him the same amount also in the second and third years. 
27:6 Jotham became powerful because he ordered his ways before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
27:7 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
27:8 He was 25 years old when he became king and reigned 16 years in Jerusalem. 
27:9 Jotham slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of David. Ahaz his son became king in his place. 
28:1 Ahaz was 20 years old when he became king, and he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem. But he did not do what was right in the eyes of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:2 but followed the ways of the kings of Israel, and even made molten images for the Baalim. 
28:3 Moreover, he burned incense in the valley of Ben-hinnom and burned his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:4 He offered sacrifices and burned incense in the high places, on the hills and under every leafy tree. 
28:5 Therefore </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:6 In one day, Pekah the son of Remaliah killed 120,000 valiant soldiers of Judah—because they had forsaken </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:7 Also Zichri, a warrior from Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, Azrikam the official in charge of the palace and Elkanah the second to the king. 
28:8 Men of Israel carried away captive 200,000 of their kinsmen, women, sons and daughters. They also took away a great deal of plunder from them that they brought to Samaria. 
28:9 But a prophet of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:10 So now you intend to bring into bondage the children of Judah and Jerusalem as your male and female slaves? Are you not also guilty of transgressions against </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:11 So now, listen to me. Send back the prisoners you have captured from your kinsmen—for the fierce wrath of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:12 Then some of the leaders of the sons of Ephraim—Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—confronted those coming from the campaign, 
28:13 and said to them, “Do not bring the captives in here, for that would cause us to trespass against </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:14 So the soldiers released the captives and the plunder in the presence of the chieftains and the entire congregation. 
28:15 Then the men designated by name stood up and took the captives, and they clothed all who were naked from the plunder. They gave them clothes and sandals, food and drink, anointed them, led all the feeble ones on donkeys, and brought them back to their kinsmen at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria.
28:16 About that time King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria for help. 
28:17 Once again the Edomites had come and invaded Judah and taken captives, 
28:18 while the Philistines had raided the towns in the foothills and in the South of Judah. They captured and occupied Beth-shemesh, Aijalon and Gederot, as well as Soho, Timnah and Gimzo with their villages. 
28:19 For </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:20 Tilgat-pilneser king of Assyria came against him and afflicted him instead of strengthening him—
28:21 even though Ahaz plundered the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:22 In his time of distress, this same King Ahaz acted even more unfaithfully to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:23 He even sacrificed to the gods of Damascus after he had been defeated, for he said, “Because the gods of the kings of Aram helped them, I will sacrifice to them and they will help me.” But they caused the downfall of him and all Israel. 
28:24 Ahaz even collected the utensils of the House of God and cut the utensils of the House of God into pieces. He shut the doors of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:25 In every town of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods—provoking </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:26 Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
28:27 Then Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of Jerusalem, but he was not brought into the tombs of the kings of Israel. Hezekiah his son became king in his place.
29:1 Hezekiah became king when he was 25 years old, and he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah. 
29:2 He did right in the eyes of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:3 In the first month of the first year of his reign, he opened the doors of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:4 He brought in the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
29:5 Then he said to them: “Listen to me, Levites! Sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:6 Our fathers acted unfaithfully and did evil in the sight of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:7 They also shut the doors of the porch and put out the lamps. They did not burn incense or offering any burnt offerings in the Holy Place to the God of Israel. 
29:8 Therefore, the wrath of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:9 Behold, for this our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons, daughters and wives are in captivity. 
29:10 “Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:11 My sons, now do not be negligent, for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:12 Then these Levites arose: from the sons of Kohath, Mahath son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah; from the sons of Merari, Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel; from the sons of Gershon, Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah; 
29:13 from the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; from the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; 
29:14 from the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and from the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel. 
29:15 When they had gathered their brothers and sanctified themselves, they went in, as the king ordered according to the words of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:16 So the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
29:17 They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and by the eighth day of the month they reached the porch of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:18 Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, “We have purified the entire House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:19 We have also prepared and concecrated all the articles that King Ahaz discarded in his unfaithfulness, while he was king. Behold, they are now before the altar of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:20 Then King Hezekiah arose early gathered the leaders of the city and went up to the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:21 They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs and seven he-goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary and Judah, and he commanded the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
29:22 So they slaughtered the bulls and the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
29:23 The he-goats for the sin offering were brought before the king and the congregation, and they laid their hands on them. 
29:24 The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
29:25 He stationed the Levites in the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:26 So the Levites stood with David’s instruments and the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
29:27 Then Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:28 The entire congregation prostrated themselves, while the singers sang and the trumpeters played. All this continued until the burnt offering was finished. 
29:29 Now at the completion of the burnt offering, the king and all who were present with him knelt down and worshiped. 
29:30 Moreover, King Hezekiah and the officials ordered the Levites to sing praises to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:31 Then Hezekiah responded and said, “You have now consecrated yourselves to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:32 The number of the burnt offerings that the congregation brought was 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs—all of these as a burnt offering to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:33 The animals consecrated as sacrifices were 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep. 
29:34 The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
29:35 There were also a great many burnt offerings, along with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offering at every burnt offering. Thus the avodah of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:36 Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because of what God had enabled the people to accomplish, because it happened so suddenly.
30:1 Hezekiah then sent word to all Israel and Judah, and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh to come to the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:2 The king and his officials and the entire congregation in Jerusalem had decided to celebrate Passover in the second month. 
30:3 For they were not able to celebrate it at the regular time, since not enough </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
30:4 The matter seemed right in the eyes of the king and of the entire community. 
30:5 So they decided to issue a decree and to proclaim it throughout all Israel from Beer-sheba to Dan, calling the people to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:6 At the king’s command, the couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his officials saying: “You men of Israel, turn back to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:7 Do not be like your fathers and brothers who acted unfaithfully against </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:8 Do not stiffen your neck as your fathers did, but reconcile to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:9 For if you return to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:10 As the couriers traveled from town to town through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh and as far as Zebulun, they were scorned and mocked. 
30:11 Nevertheless some men from Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. 
30:12 The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the officials commanded by the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:13 Now a very large assembly gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Matzot in the second month. 
30:14 They arose and removed the altars and all the incense altars that were in Jerusalem, and threw them into the Kidron Valley. 
30:15 Then they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
30:16 They stood at their post as prescribed in the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
30:17 For there were many in the congregation that had not concecrated themselves, therefore the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover lambs for everyone that was not ceremonially clean in order to concecrate them to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:18 Although a great multitude of the people—many of them from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun—had not purified themselves, they still ate the Passover lamb contrary to what is written. But Hezekiah prayed for them saying: “May </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:19 every one who prepares his heart to seek </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:20  heard Hezekiah and healed the people. 
30:21 So the children of Israel who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Matzot for seven days with great gladness. The Levites and the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
30:22 Then Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who demonstrated good understanding of the service of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:23 Then the whole congregation decided to celebrate seven more days—so for another seven days they celebrated with gladness. 
30:24 Hezekiah king of Judah contributed 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep to the congregation, and the officials contributed 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep to the congregation, and great numbers of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
30:25 The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced with the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
30:26 There was great joy in Jerusalem, for nothing like this had happened in Jerusalem since the time of Solomon son of David king of Israel.
30:27 Then the Levitical </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
31:1 When all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the towns of Judah and smashed the pillars, smashed the Asherah poles and demolished the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin, as well as throughout Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
31:2 Then Hezekiah reestablished the divisions of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
31:3 The king also contributed a portion of his own assets for the burnt offerings: the morning and the evening burnt offerings and the burnt offerings for </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Shabbatot
31:4 Moreover, he commanded the people, the residents of Jerusalem, to give the portion allotted to the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
31:5 As soon as the word spread, </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
31:6 The children of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah, also brought in the tithe of bulls and sheep, and the tithe of the sacred things consecrated to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
31:7 In the third month the heaps began to accumulate and finished in the seventh month. 
31:8 When Hezekiah and the officials came and saw the heaps, they blessed </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
31:9 Hezekiah asked the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
31:10 Azariah the chief </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
31:11 Then Hezekiah ordered them to prepare storerooms in the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
31:12 They faithfully brought in the offerings and the tithes and the consecrated gifts. Conaniah the Levite was the leader in charge over them and Shimei his brother was next in rank. 
31:13 Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath and Benaiah were supervisors under Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the leader in charge of the House of God. 
31:14 Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the East Gate, was over the freewill offerings of God, distributing the offering of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
31:15 Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah and Shecaniah faithfully assisted him in the towns of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
31:16 only considering genealogical records, to the males three years old and upward—to all who entered into the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
31:17 to the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
31:18 The genealogical registry included all their little ones, their wives and sons and daughters of the entire assembly. Thus in their faithfulness they consecrated themselves as holy. 
31:19 As for the sons of Aaron, the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
31:20 Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah. He did what was good, right and true before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
31:21 Every work he undertook in the service of the House of God and in the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
32:1 After these acts of faithfulness, Sen­na­cherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He encamped against the fortified cities, intending to break into them for himself. 
32:2 When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and intended to wage war against Jerusalem, 
32:3 he consulted with his officers and warriors about blocking the waters of the springs outside the city, and they supported him. 
32:4 Many people assembled and blocked off all the springs and the raging wadi in the land saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?” 
32:5 Then he took courage and rebuilt the entire wall that had been broken down, raised up the towers, added another outer wall, fortified the Millo in the city of David, and made plenty of weapons and shields. 
32:6 He also appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate, and encouraged them saying, 
32:7 “</span><span class="it"><span class="content">Chazak
32:8 With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
32:9 After this, when King Sennacherib of Assyria, while he and all his forces with him were besieging Lachish, sent his servants to Jerusalem to Hezekiah king of Judah and to all Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying: 
32:10 “Thus says King Sennacherib of Assyria, ‘What are you relying on that you would stay in Jerusalem, under siege? 
32:11 Is not Hezekiah misleading you, to let you die by famine and thirst, saying, “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
32:12 Has not the same Hezekiah removed His high places and His altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem saying, “You shall worship before one altar and upon it you shall burn incense?” 
32:13 Do not you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands ever able to deliver their land out of my hand? 
32:14 Who among all the gods of these nations—which my fathers utterly destroyed—could deliver his people from my hand? How then is your God able to deliver you from my hand? 
32:15 So now, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or any kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand and from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you from my hand!’” 
32:16 His servants spoke further against </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
32:17 Sennacharib also wrote letters reviling </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
32:18 Then they cried out loudly in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall to terrify and frighten them, in order to capture the city. 
32:19 They spoke against the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth made by human hands. 
32:20 Then King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz prayed about this and cried out to heaven. 
32:21 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
32:22 Thus </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
32:23 Many brought offerings to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
32:24 In those days Hezekiah became deathly ill, but he prayed to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
32:25 But Hezekiah did not respond according to the favor done to him. His heart became haughty, so wrath came upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem. 
32:26 Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride in his heart—both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem—so that the wrath of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
32:27 Now Hezekiah had very abundant riches and honor. He even made treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and for all kinds of valuables, 
32:28 and storehouses for the harvest of grain, wine and oil, and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds for the flocks. 
32:29 Moreover, he built towns and acquired flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given him very many possessions. 
32:30 It was also Hezekiah who stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon and channeled them downward to the west side of the city of David. Hezekiah succeeded in all that he did. 
32:31 But when the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon were sent to him to inquire about the wonder that had happened in the land, God left him alone to test him, to know all that was in his heart.
32:32 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
32:33 So Hezekiah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the upper section of the tombs of the sons of David. All Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. His son Manasseh became king in his place.
33:1 Manasseh was 12 years old when he became king, and he reigned 55 years in Jerusalem. 
33:2 He did evil in the sight of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:3 For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had demolished, he reerected altars for the Baalim, made Asherah poles, and bowed down to all the host of heaven and worshipped them. 
33:4 He built altars in the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:5 He also built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courtyards of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:6 Furthermore, he made his children pass through the fire in the valley of Ben-hinnom and practiced witchcraft, divination and sorcery, and consulted ghosts and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:7 Then he placed the carved image of the idol that he had made in the House of God—of which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, “In this House and in Jerusalem that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My Name forever. 
33:8 I will never again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for their fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them—all the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
33:9 But Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray, so that they did more evil than the nations whom </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:10  spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention.
33:11 Therefore, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:12 In his distress, he entreated </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:13 When he prayed to Him, He was moved by his entreaty, heard his plea and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:14 Afterward he built an outer wall to the city of David west of Gihon in the valley, as far as the entrance to the Fish Gate, and encircling the Ophel; he also raised it up much higher. He stationed military officers in all the fortified cities of Judah. 
33:15 He also removed the foreign gods and idols from the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:16 He rebuilt the altar of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:17 Nevertheless, the people still sacrificed in the high places, but only to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the Name of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:19 His prayer also, and how God was moved by his entreaty, all his sin and his unfaithfulness, and the sites on which he built high places and erected the Asherah poles and the carved images before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the records of Hozai. 
33:20 Manasseh slept with his fathers and they buried him in his own house. His son Amon became king in his place.
33:21 Amon was 22 years old when he became king and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. 
33:22 He did what was evil in the sight of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:23 He did not humble himself before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:24 So his servants conspired against him and assassinated him in his own house. 
33:25 Then the people of the land struck down all who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.
34:1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned 31 years in Jerusalem. 
34:2 He did right in the eyes of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:3 In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek after the God of his father David. In the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, the Asherah poles, and the carved and molten images. 
34:4 They tore down the altars of the Baal in his presence and chopped down the sun-images that were above them. Also the Asherah poles and the carved and molten images he smashed into pieces, ground into dust, and scattered upon the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. 
34:5 Then he burned the bones of the priests on their altars—so he purged Judah and Jerusalem. 
34:6 In the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, and as far as Naphtali, with their surrounding ruins, 
34:7 he broke down the altars, the Asherah poles, crushed the carved images into powder, and chopped down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem. 
34:8 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, after purging the land and the House, he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:9 They came to Hilkiah the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen gadol
34:10 Then they put it in the hands of the workmen who were in charge of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:11 They in turn gave it to the carpenters and the builders to buy quarried stone as well as timber—for joining and making beams—for the buildings that the kings of Judah had let fall into ruin. 
34:12 The men did the work faithfully. Over them were appointed Jahath and Obadiah, Levites from the sons of Merari, along with Zechariah and Meshullam from the sons of Kohath, to supervise, while other Levites—all skilled musicians—
34:13 were over the burden-bearers and supervised all who worked from task to task. Some of the Levites were also scribes, overseers and gatekeepers.
34:14 While they were bringing out the silver that had been brought into the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:15 Hilkiah responded by telling Shaphan the scribe, “I have found a scroll of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
34:16 Then Shaphan brought the scroll to the king and moreover returned a report to the king, saying, “Your servants are doing everything that was committed to them. 
34:17 They have melted down the silver that was found in the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:18 Shaphan the scribe also said to the king, “Hilkiah the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
34:19 When the king heard the words of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
34:20 The king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying, 
34:21 “Go! Inquire of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:22 So Hilkiah, and those whom the king commanded, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of Tokahath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe—now she was living in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter—and spoke to her about this. 
34:23 She said to them, “Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:24 “Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:25 For they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to other gods in order to provoke Me with all the works of their hands. Therefore, My wrath will be poured out upon this place and it will not be quenched.’” 
34:26 But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:27 because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His words against this place and against the inhabitants , and you humbled yourself before Me, tore your clothes, and wept before Me, I have heard you,’ says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:28 ‘Behold, I will gather you to your fathers and you will be buried in your grave in </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom
34:29 Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
34:30 The king went up to the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:31 Then the king stood in his place and made a covenant before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:32 Moreover, he made all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin stand with him. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. 
34:33 Josiah removed all the abominations from the whole territory of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
35:1 Josiah celebrated Passover unto </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
35:2 He reinstated the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
35:3 He said to the Levites who taught all Israel and who were consecrated to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
35:4 Prepare youselves by your ancestral houses in your divisions, according to the writing of King David of Israel and according to the writing of his son Solomon. 
35:5 Stand in the holy place by the divisions of the ancestral houses, by sons of the people and by divisions of ancestral houses of the Levites. 
35:6 Now sanctify yourselves, slaughter the Passover lamb and prepare it for your kinsmen, according to the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
35:7 Josiah provided for all the people who were present, flocks of lambs and goats totaling 30,000, all for the Passover offerings, as well as 3,000 bulls—all from the king’s possessions. 
35:8 His officials also gave a freewill offering to the people, the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
35:9 Likewise, Conaniah along with Shemaiah and Nethaniel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel and Jozabad, leaders of the Levites, provided 5,000 Passover lambs for the Levites and 500 bulls. 
35:10 So the avodah was prepared and the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
35:11 They slaughtered the Passover lambs and while the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
35:12 Then they removed the portions to be burnt to give them to the divisions of ancestral houses of the people to present to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
35:13 They roasted the Passover lambs with fire according to the ordinance, then boiled the sacred parts in pots, caldrons and pans, and brought them quickly to all the people. 
35:14 Afterward, they made preparations for themselves and for the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
35:15 The singers, the descendants of Asaph, were at their stations according to the commandment of David, Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun, the king’s seer. The gatekeepers were at every gate. They did not need to depart from their posts for their fellow Levites provided for them. 
35:16 So on that day the entire service of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
35:17 The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
35:18 Passover had not been celebrated like that in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet, and none of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated such a Passover as Josiah did with the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
35:19 This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah. 
35:20 After all this, when Josiah had set the House in order, King Neco of Egypt came up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates and Josiah went out to engage him. 
35:21 But Neco sent messengers to him saying, “What is there between me and you, king of Judah? I am not coming against you today but against the house that wars with me and God has ordered me to hurry. Stop for your sake from meddling with God who is with me, so that He will not destroy you!” 
35:22 Josiah, however, would not turn away from him but disguised himself in order to fight him. He did not listen to Neco’s words from the mouth of God and went to fight him in the plain of Megiddo. 
35:23 Archers shot King Josiah and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am seriously wounded.” 
35:24 So his servants carried him out of the chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had. They brought him to Jerusalem where he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned over Josiah. 
35:25 Now Jeremiah composed laments for Josiah, and to this day all the singers, male and female, commemorated Josiah in their laments. And they made them an ordinance in Israel and behold, they are written in the lamentations. 
35:26 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his deeds of devotion as written in the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
35:27 and his acts, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
36:1 Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in Jerusalem in his father’s place. 
36:2 Joahaz was 23 years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. 
36:3 The king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and imposed a fine on the land of 100 talents of silver and a talent of gold. 
36:4 The king of Egypt made Eliakim, his brother, king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt. 
36:5 Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. He did evil in the sight of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
36:6 Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon marched against him and bound him with bronze chains to take him to Babylon. 
36:7 Nebuchadnezzar also took some of the vessels of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
36:8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, the detestable things he did, and all that was found against him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place. 
36:9 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did evil in the sight of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
36:10 At the turn of the year, King Nebuchadnezzar sent and had him brought to Babylon along with the precious articles from the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
36:11 Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king and he reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. 
36:12 He did evil in the sight of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
36:13 He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar who had made him take an oath by God. He also stiffened his neck and hardened his heart so as not to turn to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
36:14 Furthermore, all the leading </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
36:15 , the God of their fathers, sent word to them through His messengers again and again, because He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place. 
36:16 But they mocked the messengers of God and despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets until the wrath of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
36:17 Therefore He brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the House of their Temple. He had no pity on young man or virgin, elderly or infirm—He gave them all into his hand. 
36:18 All the vessels of the House of God, large and small, and the treasures of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
36:19 They burned the House of God, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all the palaces with fire and destroyed everything of value. 
36:20 He exiled to Babylon those who had escaped the sword and they became slaves to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia—
36:21 in fulfillment of the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
36:22 Now in the first year of King Cyrus of Persia—fulfilling the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
