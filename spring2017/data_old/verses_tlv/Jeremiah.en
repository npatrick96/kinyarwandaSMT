1:1  who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin. 
1:2  came to him during the days of King Josiah of Judah, son of Amon, in the thirteenth year of his reign. 
1:3 It continued during the days of King Jehoiakim of Judah, son of Josiah, until the end of the eleventh year of King Zedekiah of Judah, son of Josiah—until the exile from Jerusalem in the fifth month. 
1:4  came to me, saying: 
1:5 “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, and before you were born, I set you apart— I appointed you prophet to the nations.” 
1:6 ! Look, I don’t know how to speak! For I’m still a boy!” 
1:7  answered me, “Do not say ‘I’m only a boy!’ For to everyone I send you, you will go, and all I command you, you will speak. 
1:8 . 
1:9  said to me, “Behold, I have put My words in your mouth. 
1:10 See, today I have appointed you over nations and over kingdoms: to uproot and to tear down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.” 
1:11  came to me, saying, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I answered, “I see an almond branch.” 
1:12  said to me, “You have seen correctly, for I am watching over My word to perform it.” 
1:13  came to me a second time, saying, “What do you see?” I replied, “I see a boiling pot that is tilting away from the north.” 
1:14  said to me: “From the north, disaster will be poured out on all the inhabitants of the land. 
1:15 . “So they will come and each will set up his throne at the entry of the gates of Jerusalem, against all her surrounding walls and against all the cities of Judah. 
1:16 I will pronounce My judgments on them for all their wickedness— they have forsaken Me, offering incense to other gods, worshipping the works of their hands. 
1:17 Now, you, gird up your loins! Get up and tell them everything that I order you! Do not be terrified by them, or else I will terrify you before them. 
1:18 , and against the people of the land. 
1:19 .
2:1  came to me, saying: 
2:2 : I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, and the way you followed Me in the wilderness, in a land not sown. 
2:3 . 
2:4 , O house of Jacob and all the families of the house of Israel. 
2:5 : “What fault did your fathers find in Me that they strayed so far from Me? They walked after worthless things, becoming worthless themselves? 
2:6 , who brought us up from the land of Egypt and led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and rifts, through a land of drought and distress, through a land where no one travels, where no one lives?’ 
2:7 Yet I brought you into a fertile land, to eat of its fruit and goodness. When you came, you defiled My land. You made My heritage an abomination. 
2:8  experts did not know Me. The shepherds rebelled against Me. The prophets prophesied by Baal and went after unprofitable things. 
2:9 . “I will contend with your children’s children. 
2:10 Cross to the coasts of Kittim and see! Send to Kedar, and observe carefully. See if there has been anything like this. 
2:11 Has a nation changed its gods— even though they are not gods? Yet My people have exchanged their glory for worthless things. 
2:12 . 
2:13 “My people have committed two evils: They have forsaken Me —the spring of living water— and they dug their own cisterns— cracked cisterns that hold no water. 
2:14 Is Israel a servant—a slave by birth? Then why has he become plunder? 
2:15 Young lions have roared at him they have roared loudly. They made his land a waste— his cities are in ruins and uninhabited. 
2:16 Even the sons of Noph and Tahpanhes have grazed on the crown of your head. 
2:17 Have you not brought this on yourself, when He led you in the way? 
2:18 But now, what is on the road to Egypt? Drinking the waters of the Nile? Or what is on the road to Assyria? Drinking the waters of the Euphrates? 
2:19 . 
2:20 “Indeed, long ago I broke your yoke and tore off your bonds. You said, ‘I will not serve!’ Instead, on every high hill and under every green tree you sprawled out as a prostitute. 
2:21 Yet I had planted you as a choice vine from completely faithful seed. How then did you become to Me a wandering wild vine? 
2:22 . 
2:23 “How can you say, ‘I am not defiled— I have not gone after the Baalim? Look at your behavior in the Valley! Recognize what you have done. You are a swift young camel galloping aimlessly, 
2:24 a wild donkey used to the wilderness— sniffing the wind in her passion— in her heat, who can restrain her? All males that pursue her will not tire themselves. At mating time they will find her. 
2:25 Do not run while your feet are bare and your throat is thirsty. But you said ‘There is no hope! No! For I have loved foreign gods and I will go after them.’ 
2:26  and their prophets. 
2:27 They say to wood, ‘You are my father’ and to a stone, ‘You birthed me.’ They have turned their back to Me and not their face. Yet when they are in trouble they say, ‘Rise up and save us!’ 
2:28 Where are your gods that you made for yourself? Let them come—if they can save you when you are in trouble! For you have as many gods as y0u have cities, O Judah. 
2:29 . 
2:30 “In vain I struck your children. They took no correction. Your sword devoured your prophets like a ravaging lion.” 
2:31 ’s word! “Have I been a wilderness to Israel or a land of thick darkness? Why do My people say, ‘We are free to roam. We won’t come to You any more’? 
2:32 Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me, days without number. 
2:33 How clever are your ways of seeking love. Therefore you even taught wicked women your ways. 
2:34 Moreover on your skirts is found the blood of the innocent poor —you did not find them breaking in. Yet in spite of all these things, 
2:35 you say, ‘I am innocent— surely His anger is turned away from me?’ See, I will pass judgment on you, since you say: ‘I haven’t sinned!’ 
2:36 Why do you make light of changing your way? You will be put to shame by Egypt as you were put to shame by Assyria. 
2:37  has rejected those in whom you trust— you will not prosper by them.”
3:1 . 
3:2 “Lift your eyes to the barren hills and see! Where have you not been violated? By the wayside you sat waiting for them like a nomad in the desert. You have polluted the land with your prostitution and wickedness. 
3:3 Therefore showers have been withheld and there has been no spring rain. You have a harlot’s brazen look; you refuse to be ashamed. 
3:4 Did you not just now call to Me: ‘Avi! You are a friend of my youth. 
3:5 Would He keep a grudge forever? Would He keep it to the end?’ So you said—yet you have done all the evil things you could.” 
3:6  said to me in the days of King Josiah: “Have you seen what backsliding Israel did? She went up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and there she committed adultery. 
3:7 Yet I thought that after she had done all this she would return to Me. But she did not return. Even her unfaithful sister Judah saw it. 
3:8 I noted that when backsliding Israel committed adultery I sent her away and gave her a certificate of divorce. Yet, unfaithful Judah, her sister, did not fear. Instead she also went and committed adultery. 
3:9 It happened that through her frivolous prostitution, she polluted the land and committed adultery with stones and with wood. 
3:10 . 
3:11  said to me, “Backsliding Israel has proved herself more righteous than unfaithful Judah. 
3:12 . “I will not keep a grudge forever. 
3:13 .
3:14 . “For I am your Husband. I will choose you—one from a city and two from a clan— and will bring you to Zion. 
3:15 I will give you shepherds after My own heart who will feed you knowledge and understanding. 
3:16 , nor will it come to mind or be remembered. Neither will it be missed or another one made again. 
3:17 . No longer will they walk according to the stubbornness of their evil heart. 
3:18 In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel. They will come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers as an inheritance.” 
3:19 “Then I Myself said: ‘How gladly would I make you sons and give you a pleasant land— the most beautiful inheritance of the nations!’ I thought you would call Me—Avi!— and would not turn from following Me. 
3:20 . 
3:21  their God. 
3:22 . 
3:23  is the salvation of Israel. 
3:24 But the shame has consumed the labor of our fathers since our youth— their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. 
3:25 .”
4:1 . “If you will put your detestable things out of My sight. Then you will not waver. 
4:2  lives!’ in truth, in justice and in righteousness. The nations will bless themselves in Him and in Him they will glory.” 
4:3  to the people of Judah and to Jerusalem: “Break up your unplowed ground and do not sow among thorns. 
4:4  and remove the foreskins of your heart, men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Else My wrath will break out like fire and blaze, with no one to quench it, because of your evil deeds!”
4:5  in the land!” Cry aloud and say, “Assemble yourselves! Let us go into the fortified cities.” 
4:6 “Raise a banner toward Zion! Take refuge! Do not delay! For I bring calamity from the north, even terrible destruction. 
4:7 A lion has come up from his thicket— a destroyer of nations has set out. He has left his place to make your land a wasteland. Your cities will lie in ruins, without inhabitant. 
4:8  has not turned away from us.” 
4:9  will be appalled, and the prophets will be stunned.” 
4:10 ,’ until the sword touches the soul!” 
4:11 At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A scorching wind from the barren hills in the wilderness blows toward My people, but not to winnow or to sift—
4:12 a wind too strong for these things will come from Me. Now even I will pronounce judgments against them.” 
4:13  ! We are ruined!” 
4:14 O Jerusalem, purify your heart from wickedness, so that you may be saved. How long will your wicked thoughts lodge within you? 
4:15 A voice announces from Dan and proclaims calamity from the hills of Ephraim, 
4:16 “Remind the nations, proclaim over Jerusalem! Besiegers are soon coming from a far country, raising their voice against the cities of Judah. 
4:17 . 
4:18 Your conduct and your deeds have brought these things on you. This is your calamity! How bitter it is! How it smites your heart! 
4:19 , the battle-cry of war. 
4:20 Disaster on disaster is reported. So the whole land is ruined. My tents are suddenly ravaged, my curtains in an instant. 
4:21 ? 
4:22 “For My people are foolish. They do not know Me. They are senseless children, and they have no understanding. They are wise to do evil, but to do good they do not know.” 
4:23 I looked at the earth and behold, it was deserted and desolate, and at the heavens and they had no light. 
4:24 I looked at the mountains— behold, they were shaking and all the hills swaying to and fro. 
4:25 I looked and behold, no people! All the birds of the sky had fled. 
4:26 , before His fierce anger. 
4:27 , “The whole land will be wasteland, yet I will not totally destroy it. 
4:28 Therefore, the earth will mourn and the heavens above grow black. For I have spoken, I have purposed, nor will I relent, nor turn from it. 
4:29 At the sound of horsemen and archers the whole city flees. They go into the thickets and climb up on the rocks. The whole city is deserted— no one dwells in it. 
4:30 And you, O desolate one, what will you do? Though you dress in scarlet, though you adorn yourself with gold ornaments though you enlarge your eyes with paint—in vain you make yourself beautiful— your lovers despise you, they seek your life. 
4:31  , now to me! For my soul faints before murderers.”
5:1 Roam the streets of Jerusalem, look around and consider, search through her squares! If you can find a person, if there is one who does justice, who seeks truth, then I will pardon the city. 
5:2  lives!” surely they swear falsely. 
5:3 , do Your eyes not look for faithfulness? You struck them, but they did not grieve. You disciplined them, but they refused correction. They made their faces harder than stone. They refused to return. 
5:4 , the ordinance of their God. 
5:5 , the ordinance of their God. But they too had broken the yoke and torn off the bonds. 
5:6 Therefore a lion from the forest will kill them. A desert wolf will ravage them. A leopard watches over their cities. Everyone who ventures out will be torn to pieces, For their rebellion is great, their backslidings frequent. 
5:7 “Why therefore should I forgive you? Your children have forsaken Me and sworn by those who are not gods. Even though I fed them well, they committed adultery and thronged to the prostitute houses. 
5:8 They are well-fed, lustful stallions, each neighing for his neighbor’s wife. 
5:9 . “On such a nation as this should I not avenge Myself? 
5:10 ’s. 
5:11 . 
5:12  saying: “Not He! No harm will come to us. Nor will we see sword or famine. 
5:13 The prophets are but wind and the word is not in them. Let what they say be done to them!” 
5:14 : “Because you speak this word, behold, I will make My words in your mouth fire and this people wood— and it will devour them. 
5:15 . “It is an enduring nation, an ancient nation, a nation whose language you neither know nor understand what they say. 
5:16 Their quiver is an open grave. They are all mighty warriors. 
5:17 They will devour your harvest and your food. They will devour your sons and your daughters. They will devour your flocks and your herds. They will devour your vines and your fig trees. They will demolish your fortified cities —the ones in which you trust— with the sword. 
5:18 , “I will not completely destroy you. 
5:19  done all these things to us?’ you will tell them, ‘As you have forsaken Me and served foreign gods in your land, so will you serve strangers in a land that is not yours.’ 
5:20 “Declare this in the house of Jacob and proclaim it in Judah, saying: 
5:21 ‘Hear this you foolish people who have no understanding, who have eyes but do not see, who have ears but do not hear. 
5:22 . ‘Do you not tremble in My presence?’ For I made the sand a boundary of the sea, an everlasting decree that cannot be broken. Though the waves roll, they cannot prevail. Though they roar, they cannot cross it. 
5:23 But this people have a stubborn and rebellious heart. They have turned aside and gone away. 
5:24 , who gives rain in its season —fall rain and spring rain— who reserves for us the appointed weeks of harvest.’ 
5:25 Your iniquities have turned these away, your sins have deprived you of bounty. 
5:26 For among My people are wicked men, watching like bait-layers lying in wait. They set a trap—they catch men. 
5:27 As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit. That is why they grew great and rich. 
5:28 They grew fat and sleek. They also overlooked evil deeds. They do not uphold a cause— the cause of an orphan to prosper— nor do they defend the right of the poor. 
5:29 . “On such a nation should I not avenge Myself? 
5:30 An appalling and horrible thing has happened in the land. 
5:31  rule by their own authority, and My people love it this way! But what will you do in the end?”
6:1  in Tekoa and raise a signal in Beth-cherem! For disaster looms from the north, even terrible destruction. 
6:2 “The lovely, delicate Daughter of Zion I will cut off.” 
6:3 Shepherds with their flocks are coming against her. All around her they pitch their tents, each pasturing in his own place. 
6:4  for us! For day is fading— evening shadows are lengthening.” 
6:5 “Rise up! Let’s attack at night and destroy her palaces.” 
6:6 : “Chop down her trees! Raise a siege ramp at Jerusalem. This city must be punished— in her midst is only oppression. 
6:7 As a well gushes out its waters, so she pours out her wickedness. Violence and havoc are heard in her, sickness and wounds ever before Me. 
6:8 Be warned, O Jerusalem, lest I abandon you, lest I make you desolate— an uninhabited land.” 
6:9 : “Glean the remnant of Israel thoroughly as a vine. Pass your hand over the branches once more, like a grape-gatherer.” 
6:10  has become scorn to them. They have no delight in it. 
6:11 . I am weary of holding it in! Pour it out on a child in the street, on young men gathered together. For husband will be taken with wife, the aged with the very old. 
6:12 . 
6:13 , everyone practices deceit. 
6:14 .” 
6:15 .
6:16 : “Stand in the roads and look. Ask for the ancient paths— where the good way is— and walk in it. Then you will find rest for your souls. But they said, ‘We won’t walk in it.’ 
6:17 !’ But they said, ‘We won’t listen.’ 
6:18 Therefore hear, O nations and observe, O congregation, what is against them. 
6:19 . 
6:20 Of what use to Me is frankincense coming from Sheba or sweet cane from a distant country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor are your sacrifices pleasing to Me.” 
6:21 : “Look, I am laying before this people stumbling blocks— and against them they will stumble— fathers and the sons together, a neighbor and his friend, and they will perish.” 
6:22 : “Look, a people coming from a northern land, a great nation roused from the ends of the earth! 
6:23 They are armed with bow and spear, cruel and with no compassion. They sound like the roaring sea— as they ride on horses as men in battle formation, against you, Daughter of Zion!” 
6:24 “We have heard of their fame. Our hands hang limp; anguish has gripped us, pain like a woman in labor. 
6:25 Don’t go out into the field or walk on the road. Since the enemy has a sword, there’s terror on every side!” 
6:26 “Daughter of My people, put on sackcloth and roll in ashes. Mourn as for an only son with bitter lamentation.” “For suddenly the destroyer will come on us!” 
6:27 “I have made you a metal-tester among My people—so you may observe and test their way. 
6:28 They are all stubborn rebels spreading slander. They are bronze and iron, all of them are corrupt. 
6:29 The bellows blow fiercely, blasting away the lead with fire. The refining is completely in vain, for the wicked are not drawn off. 
6:30  has cast them off.” 
7:1 , saying: 
7:2 . 
7:3 , the God of Israel; mend your ways and your deeds, and I will let you live in this place. 
7:4 !’ 
7:5 “No, if you truly mend your ways and your deeds—if you are doing justice between a man and his neighbor, 
7:6 not oppressing the sojourner, orphan and widow nor shedding innocent blood in this place, nor going after other gods to your own ruin—
7:7 then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever. 
7:8 Look, you are trusting in deceptive words that are empty. 
7:9 Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery and perjury, and offer incense to Baal and walk after other gods whom you have not known—
7:10 and then come and stand before Me in this house that bears My Name, saying, ‘We are saved!’—so that you may keep doing all these abominations? 
7:11 . 
7:12 “Indeed, go now to My place that was in Shiloh, where I first made My Name dwell. Now see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel. 
7:13 , “I spoke to you early and often, but you did not listen, and I called you but you did not answer. 
7:14 Therefore I will do to the House that bears My Name—the one in which you trust, the one that I gave to you and to your fathers—as I have done to Shiloh. 
7:15 And I will cast you out of My sight, just as I cast out all your brothers, all the offspring of Ephraim. 
7:16 “As for you, do not pray for this people. Do not offer any supplication or petition for them, nor entreat Me, because I will not hear you. 
7:17 Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
7:18 The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire and the women knead the dough to make sacrificial cakes to the queen of heaven. Moreover, they pour out drink offerings to other gods in order to provoke Me to anger. 
7:19 . “Are they not vexing themselves to their own shame?” 
7:20 : “My anger and My wrath is about to be poured out on this place—on man and beast, and on the trees of the field and the fruit of the land—and it will burn and not be quenched.” 
7:21 , the God of Israel: “Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat the meat! 
7:22 For on the day that I brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt I did not speak to them nor did I command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices, 
7:23 but I explicitly commanded them: ‘Obey My voice and I will be your God to you and you will be My people. Walk in all the ways that I command you that it may go well with you.’ 
7:24 But they did not listen or pay attention. Instead they followed their own counsel, in the stubbornness of their evil heart. They have gone backward and not forward, 
7:25 from the day your fathers left the land of Egypt until today. Although I sent to you all My servants the prophets, daily and persistently, 
7:26 they did not listen to Me or pay attention. Rather, they stiffened their neck, doing more evil than their fathers. 
7:27 “When you tell them all these things, they will not listen to you. When you call to them, they will not answer you. 
7:28  their God or received correction. Truth has perished and is cut off from their mouth. 
7:29  has spurned and cast off the generation of His wrath.”
7:30 —“They have set their detestable things in the House that bears My Name to defile it. 
7:31 They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire—which I did not command, nor did it even enter My mind. 
7:32 , “when it will no longer be called Topheth, nor the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. For they will bury in Topheth until there is no room. 
7:33 The carcasses of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth, and no one will frighten them away. 
7:34 Then I will bring an end, from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem, to the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride. For the land will be desolate.”
8:1  and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will be brought out of their graves. 
8:2 They will spread them out to the sun, the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved and served, and after which they have walked and sought, and which they have worshipped. They will not be gathered or buried, but will be like dung on the face of the ground. 
8:3 .
8:4 : “Do men fall and not get up again? Does one turn away and not return? 
8:5 Why then has this people—Jerusalem— turned away in perpetual backsliding? They cling to deceit; they refuse to return. 
8:6 I listened attentively, but they have not spoken what is right. No one repents of his wickedness, saying, ‘What have I done?’ Each one turns in his own direction, like a horse charging into battle. 
8:7 . 
8:8  is with us’? In fact, it is the lying pen of the scribes that have made it a lie. 
8:9 ’s word, so what wisdom do they have? 
8:10  everyone practices deceit. 
8:11 . 
8:12 . 
8:13 . “There will be no grapes on the vine, and no figs on the fig tree, and even the leaf will wither, and what I gave them will pass away.” 
8:14 . 
8:15 , but it is no good, for a time of healing —and suddenly, terror!” 
8:16 From Dan is heard the snorting of his horses. At the sound of his stallions neighing, the whole land quakes. For they come and devour the land and everything in it— the city and all who live there. 
8:17 .
8:18 My joy is overcome by grief, my heart is faint within me. 
8:19  no longer in Zion? Is her King no longer in her?” “Why have they provoked Me with their graven images, with foreign idols?” 
8:20 “Harvest is past, summer is over, yet we are not saved.” 
8:21 “Because of the brokenness of the daughter of my people, I am brokenhearted. I mourn—desolation grips me. 
8:22 Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Then why has no healing gone up for the daughter of my people? 
9:1 If only I had a travelers’ lodging place in the wilderness, then I might leave my people and get away from them! For they are all adulterers, a bunch of traitors. 
9:2 . 
9:3 Beware, everyone, of your neighbor! Don’t even trust a brother. For every brother grabs like Jacob and every neighbor spreads slander. 
9:4 Everyone deceives his neighbor and does not speak the truth. They taught their tongue to speak lies. They wear themselves out doing wrong. 
9:5 . 
9:6 : “I am about to refine them and test them. For what else can I do for the daughter of My people? 
9:7  to his neighbor, while inwardly setting a trap for him. 
9:8 . “Should I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?” 
9:9 For the mountains I lift up weeping and wailing, a lament for the desert pastures. For they are so scorched that no one passes through— the lowing of cattle is not heard. The birds of the air have fled and the animals are gone. 
9:10 “I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a lair for jackals. I will make the cities of Judah a wasteland without inhabitant. 
9:11  spoken that he may explain it? Why is the land ruined, laid waste like a wilderness, so that no one passes through?” 
9:12  that I set before them. They have neither obeyed My voice nor walked according to it, 
9:13 but have walked after the stubbornness of their heart, and after the Baalim that their fathers taught them. 
9:14 , the God of Israel, “look, I will make this people eat wormwood and drink poisoned water. 
9:15 I will scatter them among the nations whom neither they nor their fathers have known. I will pursue them with the sword, until I have finished with them.” 
9:16 : “Pay attention! Call the dirge-singers and let them come. Send for the most skillful wailers and let them come!” 
9:17 “Let them come quickly and lift up a wailing over us so our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids gush with water.” 
9:18 For a wailing voice is heard from Zion: “How we are ruined! We are utterly ashamed— we have forsaken the land, for they tore down our dwellings.” 
9:19 , O women, let your ear receive the word of His mouth. Teach your daughters wailing and everyone her neighbor a dirge. 
9:20 For death has climbed through our windows. It has entered into our palaces to cut off children from the street and young men from the squares.” 
9:21 . “The carcasses of men will lie like dung on the open field, like cut grain behind the reaper, with no one gathering them.” 
9:22 : “Let not the wise boast in his wisdom nor the mighty boast in his might nor the rich glory in his riches. 
9:23 . 
9:24 , “when I will punish all who are circumcised and yet uncircumcised—
9:25 Egypt, Judah, Edom and Ammon’s children and Moab, and all that have cut the corners of their hair—that dwell in the wilderness. For all the nations are uncircumcised but all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.
9:26
10:1  speaks to you, house of Israel, 
10:2 : “Do not learn the way of the nations or be frightened by signs of the heavens—though the nations are terrified by them. 
10:3 The customs of the peoples are useless: it is just a tree cut from the forest, the work of the hands of a craftsman with a chisel. 
10:4 They decorate it with silver and gold, and fasten it with hammer and nails so it won’t totter. 
10:5 Like a scarecrow in a cucumber garden, their idols cannot speak. They must be carried because they cannot walk! Do not fear them for they can do no harm —nor do any good.” 
10:6 ! You are great and great is Your Name in power. 
10:7  Who should not fear You, Ruler of the nations? For it is your due! For among all the wise of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. 
10:8 They are totally stupid and foolish. Discipline is useless—it’s wood! 
10:9 Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz. The work of the craftsman and of the goldsmith’s hands is clothed in blue and purple— all the work of skillful men. 
10:10  is truth. He is the living God and eternal King. At His wrath the earth quakes and the nations cannot endure His indignation. 
10:11 Thus you will say to them: “The gods—which did not make the heavens and the earth—will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.” 
10:12 He made the earth by His power, established the world by His wisdom, and stretched out heaven by His understanding. 
10:13 When His voice thunders, waters in heaven roar. He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings forth wind from His storehouses. 
10:14 Everyone is stupid, ignorant. Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idol! His molten image is a fraud. There is no breath in them. 
10:15 They are futile, a work of mockery. In the time of their punishment they will perish. 
10:16  is His Name.” 
10:17 Pick up your bundle from the ground, you who live under siege. 
10:18 : “I am about to hurl the inhabitants out of the land. At this time I will press hard on them so that they will be found out.” 
10:19  to me because of my brokenness! My wound is incurable. Yet I said, “This is simply a sickness and I must bear it.” 
10:20 “My tent is destroyed and all my ropes are snapped. My children are gone from me and are no more. No one is left to stretch out my tent or set up my tent curtains. 
10:21 . Therefore they have not acted wisely and all their flocks are scattered.” 
10:22 Listen! The sound of a report is coming— a great commotion out of the land of the north— to make the cities of Judah desolate, a haunt of jackals. 
10:23 , that a man’s way is not his own, nor does man, as he walks, direct his steps. 
10:24 , but with justice, not in Your anger, lest You reduce me to nothing. 
10:25 Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge You and on the families that do not call on Your Name. For they have devoured Jacob, devoured and consumed him, and destroyed his homeland. 
11:1 , saying: 
11:2 Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the people of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
11:3 , the God of Israel: “Cursed is the one who does not obey the words of this covenant, 
11:4 which I commanded your forefathers in the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt—out of the iron furnace—saying: ‘Listen to My voice, and do all that I command you. Then you will be My people, and I will be your God. 
11:5 .” 
11:6  said to me: “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: ‘Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.’ 
11:7 For I earnestly forewarned your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt until this day, forewarning early and often, saying ‘Listen to My voice!’ 
11:8 Yet they would not obey or incline their ear, but each one walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant—which I commanded them to do, but they did not.” 
11:9  said to me, “A conspiracy has been discovered among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
11:10 They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers who refused to hear My words. They have gone after other gods to serve them. “The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.” 
11:11 . “I will soon bring a disaster on them that they will not be able to escape. They will cry out to Me, yet I will not listen to them. 
11:12 Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense—but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble. 
11:13 For as numerous as your cities are your gods, O Judah, and as numerous as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful thing—altars to burn incense to Baal. 
11:14 As for you, you are not to pray for this people or lift up supplication or prayer for them, for I will not hear them at the time they cry out to Me because of their disaster.”
11:15 “What is My beloved doing in My House as she does evil schemes with many? Can holy meat prevent your disaster? So you may rejoice? 
11:16  called your name— a leafy olive tree, beautiful with well-formed fruit. With the noise of a great tumult He has set it on fire, and its branches are broken. 
11:17 , who planted you, has pronounced evil against you because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done to themselves, provoking Me by offering sacrifices to Baal. 
11:18  gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it, then You showed me their deeds. 
11:19 But I was like a gentle lamb led to slaughter. I did not know they had devised plots against me: “Let us destroy the tree with its fruit. Let us cut him off from the land of the living, so that his name will be no more remembered.” 
11:20 , who judges righteously, who tests the mind and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them. For to You I have made my cause known. 
11:21 , so you would not die by our hand.” 
11:22 : “I am about to punish them! The young men will die by the sword; their sons and their daughters will die by famine. 
11:23 No remnant will be left to them, for I will bring calamity on the men of Anathoth—the year of their visitation.
12:1 , when I plead my case with You. Yet I speak with You about justice. Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all the treacherous thrive? 
12:2 You planted them, so they have taken root. They are growing, bearing fruit. You are near in their mouth, yet far from their mind. 
12:3 . You see me, and examine my heart toward You. Drag them off like sheep for slaughter. Set them apart for the day of carnage. 
12:4 How long will the land mourn and the grass of all the field wither? Because those living in it are evil, beasts and birds are swept away. For they said, “He cannot see our end.” 
12:5 “If you raced with those on foot and they wore you out, how can you compete with horses? If you are secure in a land of peace, how will you do in Jordan’s thickets? 
12:6 For even your brothers —your father’s house— even they will betray you, even they will shout out after you. Have no confidence in them, even if they say nice words to you.” 
12:7 “I have abandoned My House. I have forsaken My inheritance. I have given the beloved of My soul Into the hand of her enemies. 
12:8 My inheritance became to Me like a lion in the forest— her voice roared against Me! Therefore I despised her. 
12:9 Is My inheritance a speckled vulture? Are vultures circling all around her? Go, gather all the wild beasts, bring them for devouring!
12:10 “Many shepherds ruined My vineyard. They trampled My property. They made My pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. 
12:11 They made it a wasteland. It mourns before Me, desolate. The whole land will be laid waste, because no one takes it to heart.” 
12:12 . 
12:13 ’s fierce anger. 
12:14 , “As for all My evil neighbors who strike at the inheritance that I bequeathed to My people Israel—I am about to uproot them from their land and pluck the house of Judah from them. 
12:15 Yet it will come to pass, after I have uprooted them, that I will again have compassion on them and I will bring them back, each one to his inheritance and each one to his land. 
12:16  lives,’ just as they taught My people to swear by Baal—then they will be built up in the midst of My people. 
12:17 . 
13:1  said to me: “Go, and buy yourself a linen waistband and put it around your waist, and do not put it in water.” 
13:2 , and put it on my waist. 
13:3  came to me a second time, saying: 
13:4 “Take the waistband that you bought, which is on your waist, and get up, go to Perath and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.” 
13:5  commanded me. 
13:6  said to me: “Get up, go to Perath, and take the waistband that I commanded you to hide there.” 
13:7 So I went to Perath, dug it up and took the waistband from the place where I had hidden it. But to my surprise, the waistband was marred, worth nothing at all. 
13:8  came to me, saying, 
13:9 : “Just so I will mar the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. 
13:10 This wicked people, who refuse to hear My words, who walk in the stubbornness of their own heart, and go after other gods to serve them and worship them, will be just like this waistband—worth nothing at all. 
13:11 , “to be to Me a people, a name, a praise and a glory. But they would not obey.” 
13:12 , the God of Israel: “Every jug should be filled with wine.” When they say to you, ‘Don’t we know very well that every jug should be filled with wine?’ 
13:13 , the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem—with drunkenness. 
13:14 . ‘I will show no pity, nor regret, nor compassion, to keep Me from destroying them.’”
13:15  has spoken. 
13:16  your God, before it grows dark, and before your feet stumble on mountains at dusk. When you look for light, He turns it into the shadow of death, and turns it into deep darkness. 
13:17 ’s flock will be taken captive. 
13:18 Say to the king and the queen mother: “Sit down low, for your glorious crown has fallen from your head.” 
13:19 The towns of the South will be shut up, with no one to open them. All Judah is taken into exile— utterly swept into exile. 
13:20 Lift up your eyes and see those coming from the north. Where is the flock given to you, Your beautiful sheep? 
13:21 What will you say, when He sets up the allies you cultivated for yourself, over you as head? Will not labor pains seize you, like a woman in travail? 
13:22 Suppose you say in your heart, “Why did these things happen to me?” Because of your great iniquity, your skirts are uncovered and your heels suffer violence. 
13:23 Can the Ethiopian change his skin? Or the leopard his spots? So, could you do good, that are accustomed to doing evil? 
13:24 “Therefore I will scatter them like drifting straw in the desert wind. 
13:25 . “For you have forgotten Me and trusted in falsehood. 
13:26 Therefore I will also uncover your skirts over your face, expose your shame. 
13:27  you, Jerusalem! You are unclean! How much longer?”
14:1  that came to Jeremiah concerning the droughts: 
14:2 Judah will mourn, and her gates languish. They will bow in black to the ground And Jerusalem’s wail will go up. 
14:3 Their nobles will send their lads for water. They come to the cisterns, but find no water. Their jars return empty. They are ashamed and humiliated; they cover their heads. 
14:4 Because the ground is cracked, since there has been no rain in the land, the farmers are ashamed— they cover their heads. 
14:5 For even the doe in the field abandons her newborn fawn, because there is no grass. 
14:6 Wild donkeys stand on the barren hills, as they pant for air like jackals. Their eyes fail, since there is no foliage. 
14:7 , act for Your Name’s sake. For our backslidings are many. We have sinned against You. 
14:8 O hope of Israel, Savior in time of trouble, why are You like a stranger in the land, or like a traveler who stays for a night? 
14:9 , are in our midst, and we are called by Your Name. Do not forsake us! 
14:10  does not accept them. Now will He remember their iniquity, and punish their sins. 
14:11  said to me: “Do not pray for the good of this people. 
14:12 If they fast, I will not hear their cry. If they offer burnt offering or grain offering, I will not accept them. Instead I will consume them with sword, with famine and with plague.” 
14:13 ! The prophets keep telling them: ‘You will not see the sword nor famine, but I will give you true peace in this place.’” 
14:14  said to me: “The prophets prophesy lies in My Name! I did not send them, nor commanded them, nor did I speak to them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, divination, futility, a delusion of their heart.” 
14:15 : “About the prophets who prophesy in My Name, though I did not send them, yet keep saying, ‘Sword and famine will never be in this land’—by sword and famine will those prophets be consumed. 
14:16 Also the people to whom they prophesy will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem, because of the famine and the sword. They will have no one to bury them, their wives, their sons or their daughters. For I will pour their disaster on them.” 
14:17 You will say this word to them: “Let my eyes overflow with tears. Night and day, may they never stop. For the virgin daughter of my people is crushed with a great blow, with a sorely infected wound.”
14:18  will travel to a land they do not know. 
14:19 , but nothing good came, and for a time of healing, but suddenly, terror! 
14:20 , the iniquity of our fathers, for we have sinned against You. 
14:21 Do not despise us, for Your Name’s sake. Do not dishonor Your glorious throne. Remember Your covenant with us— do not break it! 
14:22  our God? Do we not wait for You? For You have done all these things. 
15:1  to me: “Even if Moses and Samuel stood before Me, My soul could not be toward this people. Cast them out of My presence, and let them go out!” 
15:2 : “Those for death—to death! Those for the sword—to the sword! Those for famine—to famine! Those for exile—to exile! 
15:3 — “the sword to slay, the dogs to drag, the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth to devour and to destroy. 
15:4 “So I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem. 
15:5 “Who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? Or who will grieve for you? Or who will turn aside to ask about your welfare? 
15:6 — “You keep going backward! So I stretch out My hand against you and will destroy you. I am weary with relenting. 
15:7 I will scatter them with a winnowing fork at the gates of the land. I will bereave them of children and destroy My people, since they do not repent of their ways. 
15:8 Their widows will increase before Me more than the sand of the seas, I will bring a destroyer at noonday against the mother of a young man. Suddenly I will bring down on her anguish and terrors. 
15:9 . 
15:10  to me, my mother, that you gave birth to me— a man of strife and conflict to all the land! I did not lend or borrow, yet everyone curses me. 
15:11  said: “Surely I will release you for good. Surely I will make the enemy appeal to you in a time of trouble, in a time of affliction. 
15:12 Can anyone smash iron— iron and bronze from the north? 
15:13 Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder without cost, for all your sins, in all your borders. 
15:14 I will take you away with your enemies into a land you do not know, for a fire is kindled in My nostril, which will burn against you.” 
15:15 , you know. Remember me and think of me. Avenge me against my persecutors. Because of Your long-suffering, do not take me away. Know that for Your sake I endure scorn. 
15:16 . 
15:17 I never sat in the company of revelers nor made merry. Because of Your hand I sat alone, for You filled me with indignation. 
15:18 Why is my pain unending and my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? Will You be to me like a mirage of water that is undependable? 
15:19 : “If you return, I will restore you, you will stand before Me. If you extract the precious from the worthless, you will be as My mouth. Let them turn to you, but you must not turn to them. 
15:20 . 
15:21 “So I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the grasp of the ruthless.”
16:1  came to me, saying: 
16:2 “You will not take a wife for yourself or have sons or daughters in this place.” 
16:3  about the sons and daughters born in this place, and about their mothers who give birth to them and about their fathers who father them in this land: 
16:4 They will die of deadly diseases. They will not be lamented or buried, but will be like dung on the surface of the ground. They will be consumed by the sword and famine, and their carcasses will be food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth. 
16:5 —“as well as My mercy and compassion. 
16:6 Both great and small will die in this land; they will not be buried; neither will anyone lament for them, or cut themselves or shave his head for them. 
16:7 No one will break bread for them in mourning, to give comfort for the dead. Nor will anyone offer a cup of consolation to drink for anyone’s father or for his mother. 
16:8 “You must not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink” 
16:9 , the God of Israel: “I am about to eliminate from this place, before your eyes and in your days, the sound of joy and the sound of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride. 
16:10  our God?’ 
16:11 . 
16:12 Yes, you have done worse than your fathers. For here you are, each of you walking after the stubbornness of his evil heart, not listening to Me. 
16:13 So I will cast you out of this land into a land that you have not known—neither you nor your fathers—and there you will serve other gods day and night. For I will give you no grace.’
16:14  lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.’ 
16:15  lives, who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north and from all the lands where He had banished them.’ So I will bring them back into their land that I gave to their fathers. 
16:16 , “and they will fish for them. After that, I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down from every mountain and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks. 
16:17 For My eyes are on all their ways. They are not hidden from My face, nor is their iniquity concealed from My eyes. 
16:18 First I will repay them double for their iniquity and their sin, because they have profaned My land, and they have filled My possession with the carcasses of their vile things and their abominations.” 
16:19 , my strength, my stronghold, my refuge in the day of affliction, to You will the nations come from the ends of the earth and say: “Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies, futility and useless things.” 
16:20 Will man make gods for himself? Yet they are not gods. 
16:21 .”
17:1 Judah’s sin is written with an iron pen and with a point of a diamond, engraved on the tablet of their heart and on the horns of your altars. 
17:2 So their children remember their altars and their Asherah poles by leafy trees on the high hills. 
17:3 My mountain in the country, your wealth and all your treasures I will give away as plunder, along with your high places for sin within all your borders. 
17:4 So you, on your own, let go of your heritage that I gave you. So I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know. For you have kindled a fire in My nose that will burn forever.”
17:5 . 
17:6 For he will be like a bush in the desert. He cannot see goodness when it comes, but will dwell in parched places in the wilderness— a salt land where no one lives. 
17:7 . 
17:8 For he will be like a tree planted by the waters, spreading out its roots by a stream. It has no fear when heat comes, but its leaves will be green. It does not worry in a year of drought, nor depart from yielding fruit.
17:9 “The heart is deceitful above all things, and incurable—who can know it? 
17:10  search the heart, I try the mind, to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his deeds. 
17:11 As a partridge that broods over young that she did not lay, so is one who gets wealth, unjustly. In the middle of his days it will abandon him, so at his end he will be a fool. 
17:12 Throne of glory on high from the beginning! Place of our sanctuary, 
17:13 , the fountain of living waters. 
17:14 , and I will be healed. Save me, and I will be saved. For You are my praise. 
17:15 ? Let it come now!” 
17:16 As for me, I have not run away from being a shepherd after You, nor have I desired the woeful day. What came out of my lips You know—it was before You. 
17:17 Be not a ruin to me— You are my refuge in the evil day. 
17:18 Let my persecutors be ashamed, yet let me not be ashamed. Let them be dismayed, but let me not be dismayed. Bring on them the evil day, Destroy them with double destruction.
17:19  to me: “Go, stand in the gate of the children of the people, through which the kings of Judah come in and go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem, 
17:20 , kings of Judah, and all Judah and all inhabitants of Jerusalem who enter through these gates! 
17:21  or bring it in through the gates of Jerusalem. 
17:22  holy—as I commanded your fathers.” 
17:23 Yet they did not listen or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck, not hearing or accepting correction. 
17:24  and do no work on it, 
17:25 then there will enter in through the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses—with their princes, the people of Judah and those dwelling in Jerusalem—and this city will be inhabited forever. 
17:26 . 
17:27  holy, by not bearing a burden or entering through the gates of Jerusalem on Yom Shabbat, then I will set its gates on fire, and it will consume the citadels of Jerusalem, and not be quenched.’”
18:1 , saying: 
18:2 “Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause you to hear My words.” 
18:3 So I went down to the potter’s house, and there he was making a work on the wheels. 
18:4 Whenever the pot that he was making from the clay became flawed in the hand of the potter, he remade it into another pot, as it pleased the potter to make. 
18:5  came to me, saying: 
18:6 . “Behold, as the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel. 
18:7 At one moment I may speak about a nation or about a kingdom, to uproot, to pull down or to destroy it. 
18:8 But if that nation turns from their evil, because of what I have spoken against it, I will relent concerning the calamity that I planned to do to it. 
18:9 Or at another time I may speak about a nation or about a kingdom, to build up or to plant it. 
18:10 But if it does evil in My sight, not listening to My voice, then I will relent of the good that I had said I would do to it.” 
18:11 : “I am about to bring calamity against you, and devise disaster against you. Turn back now—everyone from his evil way—and amend your ways and your doings. 
18:12 But they say: ‘It’s hopeless! So we will walk after our own plans, and each of us will act in the stubbornness of his evil heart.’” 
18:13 : “Ask now among the nations, whoever has heard such things? The virgin of Israel has done a most terrible thing. 
18:14 Does the snow of Lebanon abandon the rock of the field? Or is the cold water flowing from afar pulled back? 
18:15 Yet My people have forgotten Me. They burn incense to a delusion and stumble in their ways— off the ancient paths— to walk on side-tracks, rather than a built-up highway. 
18:16 Their land will become a horror, a perpetual hissing— every one passing by will be stunned and shake his head. 
18:17 Like an east wind, I will scatter them before the enemy. I will see their back, not their face, in the day of their calamity.”
18:18  will not be lost, nor will counsel from the wise, nor will the word from the prophet. Come, let’s strike at him with the tongue, and pay no attention to any of his words.” 
18:19 ! Listen to the voice of my opponents. 
18:20 Will good be repaid for evil? For they dug a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before You to speak good on their behalf, to turn Your wrath from them. 
18:21 Therefore give their children to famine and pour out the power of the sword. Let their wives be bereaved of children, and widows, and let their men be slain to death, and their young men struck down by the sword in battle. 
18:22 Let a cry be heard from their houses when suddenly You bring a troop on them. For they dug a pit to capture me, and hid snares for my feet. 
18:23 , against me to slay me. Do not forgive their iniquity or blot out their sin before You. But make them stumble before You. Act against them in the time of Your anger.
19:1 , 
19:2 and go out to the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. Proclaim there the words that I will tell you, 
19:3 , the God of Israel: ‘I am about to bring such a catastrophe on this place that whoever hears about it, his ears will tingle. 
19:4 For they have forsaken Me and have alienated this place, by burning sacrifices in it to other gods, which neither they nor their forefathers, nor the kings of Judah have known. They have also filled this place with the blood of innocents. 
19:5 They have built high places for Baal, in order to burn their children in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal—something I never commanded, nor mentioned, nor did it ever come into My mind.’” 
19:6 —“when this place will no longer be called Topheth or The Valley of Ben-Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. 
19:7 So I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place. I will have them fall by the sword before their enemies, by the hand of them that seek their life. I will give their carcasses as food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth. 
19:8 And I will make this city a horror and a hissing—every one passing by will be stunned and hiss because of all her wounds. 
19:9 And I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters, and everyone will eat his companion’s flesh during the siege and distress, which their enemies and those who seek their life will inflict on them. 
19:10 “Then you will shatter the jar in the presence of the people who accompany you, 
19:11 : ‘Even so I will shatter this people and this city, as one shatters a potter’s jar, which can never be made whole again. So they will be burying in Topheth, for there will be no other place to bury.’” 
19:12 —“and to its inhabitants, making this city as Topheth. 
19:13 The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be as defiled as the place Topheth—all the houses on whose roofs they burned incense to the whole heavenly host and poured out drink offerings to other gods.” 
19:14 ’s House, and said to all the people, 
19:15 , the God of Israel: “I am about to bring on this city and on all her towns the whole disaster that I pronounced against it, because they stiffened their neck, rather than hearing My words.”
20:1 , heard Jeremiah prophesying these things, 
20:2 . 
20:3  no longer calls your name Pashhur, but Magormissabib. 
20:4 : ‘Behold, I will make you a terror both to yourself and to everyone you love. They will fall by the sword of their enemies, while your eyes look on. So I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them captive to Babylon and will slay them with the sword. 
20:5 “Moreover I will give away all the wealth of this city, and all its produce and its precious things, even all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give over to the hand of their enemies, who will plunder them, take them away, and bring them to Babylon. 
20:6 “As for you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house, you will go into captivity, and you will go to Babylon. So there you will die, and there you will be buried—you and all your friends—to whom you have prophesied falsely.”
20:7 , You enticed me, so I was enticed. You overpowered me, and prevailed. I am a laughingstock all day long. Everyone mocks me. 
20:8  is scorn and ridicule to me all day long. 
20:9 But if I say: “I won’t mention Him, or speak any more in His Name,” then it is like fire burning in my heart— shut up in my bones— I weary myself holding it in, but I cannot. 
20:10 For I heard the whispering of many: “‘Terror on every side?’ Denounce him! Let’s denounce him!” Even all my close friends are watching for my fall: “Perhaps he may be deceived, so we’ll get the better of him, and we’ll get our revenge on him.” 
20:11  is with me like a dreadful warrior. Therefore my persecutors will stumble and will not prevail. Since they are not insightful and not wise, they will be utterly shamed— an everlasting disgrace, never to be forgotten. 
20:12 — testing the righteous, seeing the mind and the heart, let me see Your vengeance on them! For to You have I presented my case. 
20:13 ! For He has delivered the soul of the needy one from the hand of evildoers. 
20:14 Cursed be the day I was born! The day that my mother bore me— may it never be blessed! 
20:15 Cursed be the one who brought the news to my father, saying, “A baby boy is born to you!” making him so glad. 
20:16  overturned, with no relenting— let him hear a cry in the morning and a shout of alarm at noon, 
20:17 since he did not kill me in the womb, so my mother might have been my grave—her womb filled forever. 
20:18 Why did I ever come forth out of the womb to see trouble and sorrow, and my days end in shame?
21:1 , saying: 
21:2  would deal with us according to all His wondrous miracles—so that he would withdraw from us?” 
21:3 Then said Jeremiah to them, “Thus will you say to Zedekiah, 
21:4 , the God of Israel: ‘I will soon turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, which you use to fight against the king of Babylon and against the Chaldeans, who are besieging you outside the walls—I will assemble them in the center of this city. 
21:5 I myself will fight against you, with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even with anger, fury and in great wrath. 
21:6 I will also strike down the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast—they will die of a great pestilence.’” 
21:7 , “I will deliver King Zedekiah of Judah and his servants, as well as the people—those surviving in this city from the pestilence, the sword and the famine—into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, into the hand of their foes, yes, into the hand of those who seek their life. So he will smite them with the edge of the sword; he will not spare them, nor have pity or compassion.” 
21:8 : “Look, I set before you the way of life and the way of death. 
21:9 He who remains in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, or by the pestilence. But whoever goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you, he will live, and he will have his life as prize.” 
21:10 . “It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire.” 
21:11 , 
21:12 : “Render justice by morning, and rescue the one who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor. Otherwise My fury will go forth like fire and burn so none can extinguish it, because of their evil deeds.” 
21:13 —“You are saying, ‘Who would come down against us? Who would enter into our lairs?’ 
21:14 . “Also I will set fire to her forest, and it will consume all around her.” 
22:1 : “Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and speak this word: 
22:2 , O king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David—you, your servants, and your people who enter by these gates.’ 
22:3 : ‘Execute justice and righteousness. Rescue the one who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor. Do not mistreat or do violence to the stranger, the fatherless or the widow. Do not shed innocent blood in this place. 
22:4 For if you really carry out this word, then through the gates of this palace will enter kings sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses—himself, his servants, and his people. 
22:5 , ‘that this palace will become a ruin.’” 
22:6  concerning the house of the king of Judah: “You are Gilead to Me— the summit of Lebanon, yet I will surely make you into a wilderness, uninhabited cities. 
22:7 I will consecrate destroyers against you, each with his own weapons. They will cut down your choice cedars and cast them into the fire. 
22:8  done such a thing to this great city?’ 
22:9  their God, and worshipped other gods and served them.’” 
22:10 Weep not for the dead or bemoan him. Weep bitterly for him who departs, for he will never return, or see his native country again. 
22:11  to Shallum, son of King Josiah of Judah, who became king in place of his father Josiah: “He who went forth from this place will never return there. 
22:12 Instead, in the place where they led him captive, there will he die—he will see this land no more.” 
22:13  to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, and his roof-chambers by injustice, that makes his neighbor work without pay, never giving him his wages, 
22:14 who says: “I will build myself a big house with spacious rooms and cut out my windows for it, and panel it with cedar, and paint it with vermilion! 
22:15 Did you become king just to be striving with cedar? Did your father not eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? Then it went well with him. 
22:16 . 
22:17 “But your eyes and your heart are only on your unjust gain, and on shedding innocent blood, and committing extortion and fraud.” 
22:18  , his majesty!’ 
22:19 With a donkey’s burial will he be buried, dragged off and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem. 
22:20 Go up to Lebanon and cry out, and lift up your voice in Bashan, and cry from Abarim— for all your lovers are broken. 
22:21 I spoke to you in your prosperity, but you said, ‘I won’t listen!’ This has been your way since your youth— for you never listened to My voice. 
22:22 The wind will shepherd away all of your shepherds, and your lovers will go into exile. Surely then you will be ashamed and humbled by all your wickedness. 
22:23 O inhabitant of Lebanon, nestled in the cedars, how you will groan when pangs come on you, pain like a woman in travail! 
22:24 , “even if Coniah son of King Jehoiakim of Judah were a signet ring on My right hand, yet I would pull you off, 
22:25 and give you over into the hand of those seeking your life, yes, into the hand of those whom you dread, even into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans. 
22:26 So I will cast you out, with your mother who bore you, into another country where you were not born—and there will you die. 
22:27 But as for the land where they long to return, they will never return there.” 
22:28 Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered pot— a jar with no delight in it? Why are he and his seed cast out into the land they do not know? 
22:29 ! 
22:30 : “Write this man childless, a man who will not prosper in his days. For no man of his seed will prosper, sitting on the throne of David and ruling again in Judah.”
23:1 . 
23:2 . 
23:3 “I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and will bring them back to their folds, and they will be fruitful and multiply. 
23:4 . 
23:5 — “when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and He will reign as king wisely, and execute justice and righteousness in the land. 
23:6  our righteousness. 
23:7  lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.’ 
23:8  lives, who brought up and led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country and from all the lands where He had banished them.’ So they will dwell in their own soil. 
23:9 , because of His holy words. 
23:10 For the land is full of adulterers. The land mourns because of a curse. Pastures of the wilderness are dry. Their running is evil, and their might is not right. 
23:11 . 
23:12 . 
23:13 Moreover, I have seen unseemliness in the prophets of Samaria: they prophesied by Baal, and led My people Israel astray. 
23:14 But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: committing adultery and walking in lies. They strengthen the hands of evildoers. No one turns back from his evil. They are all like Sodom to Me and her inhabitants like Gomorrah.” 
23:15  concerning the prophets: “I myself will feed them wormwood and make them drink poisoned water. For from the prophets of Jerusalem pollution has spread into all the land.” 
23:16 . 
23:17 .’ To everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say: ‘No evil will come on you.’” 
23:18 , that he should see and hear His word? Who has heard to His word and obeyed? 
23:19  goes out in fury, yes, a whirling tempest will swirl down on the head of the wicked. 
23:20  will not turn until He has executed and fulfilled the purposes of His heart. In the last days you will discern it clearly. 
23:21 “I did not send those prophets, yet they ran. I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied. 
23:22 If they have stood in My council, then they would have announced My words to My people, and turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their deeds.” 
23:23 — “and not God when far off? 
23:24 . 
23:25 “I have heard what the prophets said, who prophesy lies in My Name, saying: ‘I had a dream, I had a dream!’ 
23:26 How long will this continue? Is there anything in the heart of such prophets prophesying lies? These prophets have deception in their heart. 
23:27 Through their dreams that they each tell to his companion, that intend to make My people forget My Name—just as their fathers forgot My Name because of Baal. 
23:28 . 
23:29 , “or like a hammer that shatters rock? 
23:30 —“who steal My words from each other. 
23:31 , “who use their tongues to utter a prophecy, ‘It is a declaration!’ 
23:32 . 
23:33 . 
23:34 !’—I will punish that man and his household. 
23:35  spoken?’ 
23:36  our God. 
23:37  spoken?’ 
23:38 ’—
23:39 therefore, I will surely forget you when I will cast you off, along with the city that I gave to you and to your fathers, away from My presence. 
23:40 Then I will bring everlasting disgrace on you and everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.”
24:1 . It was after King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had taken away into exile Jeconiah son of King Jehoiakim of Judah and the princes of Judah, along with the craftsmen and smiths from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. 
24:2 One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first ripe, but the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad. 
24:3  said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” So I said, “Figs—the good figs are very good, but the bad are very bad, and cannot be eaten, they are so bad.” 
24:4  came to me, saying, 
24:5 , the God of Israel: “Like these good figs, so will I regard the exiles of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place to the land of the Chaldeans, as good. 
24:6 I will set My eyes on them as good. I will bring them back to this land, and I will build them up and not pull them down; I will plant them and not uproot them. 
24:7 —and they will be My people, and I will be their God. For they will return to Me with their whole heart. 
24:8 —“so I will give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, his princes and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, as well as those dwelling in the land of Egypt. 
24:9 I will even give them as a horror, as an evil thing, among all the kingdoms of the earth—as a disgrace and a proverb, a taunt and a curse—in all places where I will drive them. 
24:10 I will also send the sword, famine and pestilence among them, until they be consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.” 
25:1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah (which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon). 
25:2 Jeremiah the prophet spoke it to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: 
25:3  has come to me. So I have spoken to you, speaking early and often, but you have not listened. 
25:4  has sent to you all His servants the prophets, sending them early and often—but you have not listened or inclined your ear to hear—
25:5  has given to you and to your fathers forever and ever. 
25:6 Do not go after other gods to serve them, to worship them, and so do not provoke Me with the work of your hands, so I would do you no harm.’ 
25:7 . “So you are provoking Me with the work of your hands, to your own hurt.” 
25:8 : “Since you have not heard My words, 
25:9 —“and I will send for King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations round about, and I will utterly destroy them, and make them a horror, and a hissing, an enduring desolation. 
25:10 “Moreover, I will silence among them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.
25:11 “So this whole land will be a desolate ruin, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for 70 years. 
25:12 , “the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, and I will make it ruins forever. 
25:13 I will bring on that land all My words which I pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations. 
25:14 For many nations and great kings will make slaves of them also. So I will repay them according to their deeds and according to the work of their own hands.” 
25:15 , the God of Israel, to me: “Take this cup of the wine of fury from My hand, and make all the nations to whom I am sending you drink it. 
25:16 They will drink, and reel to and fro, and be like madmen, because of the sword that I will send among them. 
25:17  had sent me: 
25:18 Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with its kings and its princes—to make them an appalling horror and hissing, a curse as it is this day; 
25:19 Pharaoh king of Egypt, with his servants, his princes and all his people; 
25:20 and all the mingled people, all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the land of the Philistines, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod; 
25:21 Edom, Moab, and Ammon’s children; 
25:22 all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the coastland across the sea; 
25:23 Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who shave the corners; 
25:24 all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed people dwelling in the wilderness; 
25:25 all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam and all the kings of Media; 
25:26 all the kings of the north, either far or close to another; and all the kingdoms of the world which are on the face of the earth. And the king of Sheshach will drink after them.” 
25:27 , the God of Israel: “Drink, be drunken, vomit, fall down and rise no more, because of the sword that I will send among you.” 
25:28 , you will surely drink! 
25:29 . 
25:30  is roaring from on high, giving voice from His holy dwelling. He roars mightily over His sheepfold. He shouts like those who tread grapes, against all who dwell on the earth. 
25:31 . 
25:32 : “Evil will soon go forth from nation to nation. A great storm is being stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth. 
25:33  on that day will be from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth. They will not be lamented, gathered, or buried; they will be dung on the surface of the ground.” 
25:34 Wail, you shepherds, and cry! Wallow in the dust, you leaders of the flock! For the days of your slaughter and your dispersions are full. You will fall like a precious vase. 
25:35 For the shepherds will have no way to flee, nor the leaders of the flock to escape. 
25:36  is ravaging their pasture. 
25:37 . 
25:38 He has left His lair, like a lion. For their land has become a waste, because of the fury of the oppressor and because of His fierce anger. 
26:1 , saying, 
26:2 ’s House all the words that I command you to speak to them. Do not omit a word! 
26:3 Perhaps they will listen, and turn every man from his evil way, so I may relent of the calamity which I am planning to do to them because of the evil of their deeds.” 
26:4 , which I have set before you, 
26:5 and by listening to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I have been sending to you, early and often—but you have not listened—
26:6 then I will make this House like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.” 
26:7 . 
26:8  and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him, saying: “You will surely die! 
26:9 . 
26:10 ’s House. 
26:11  and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people, saying: “A death sentence for this man! For he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.” 
26:12  sent me to prophesy all the words you have heard against this House and against this city. 
26:13  will relent of the calamity that He has pronounced against you. 
26:14 “But as for me, here I am in your hand; do with me as is good and right in your eyes. 
26:15  has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.” 
26:16  our God.” 
26:17 Then some of the elders of the land rose up and addressed all the assembly of the people, saying: 
26:18 : ‘Zion will be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem will become ruins, and the mountain of the House as the high places of a forest.’ 
26:19  relented of the calamity that He had pronounced against them? So we may be committing great evil against our own souls.” 
26:20 , Uriah son of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against this land words like all those of Jeremiah. 
26:21 When King Jehoiakim with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But when Uriah heard it, he was afraid and fled, and went to Egypt. 
26:22 So King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt—Elnathan son of Achbor and some others with him—
26:23 and they brought Uriah back from Egypt, and led him to King Jehoiakim, who slew him with the sword and threw his corpse into the burial place of the common people. 
26:24 Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that they did not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death. 
27:1 , saying—
27:2  to me—“Make straps and yoke-bars, and put them on your neck. 
27:3 Then send such to the king of Edom, to the king of Moab, to the king of Ammon’s children, to the king of Tyre and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of messengers that come to Jerusalem to King Zedekiah of Judah. 
27:4 , the God of Israel, thus will you say to your masters: 
27:5 ‘I have made the earth, mankind and beast which are on the face of the earth, by My great power and by My outstretched arm—and I give it to whom it seems right to Me. 
27:6 So now I have given all these lands into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, My servant. I have even given the beasts of the field to serve him. 
27:7 All the nations will serve him—and his son, and his grandson—until the time of his own land comes, and then many nations and great kings will make him their slave.’ 
27:8 , “until I have destroyed it by his hand. 
27:9 But as for you, do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreams, your soothsayers, or your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon.’ 
27:10 For they prophesy a lie to you, in order to remove you far from your land, so that I would drive you out and you would perish. 
27:11 . 
27:12 Then I spoke to King Zedekiah of Judah with all these same words, saying: “Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, serve him and his people—and live. 
27:13  has spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? 
27:14 Do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they prophesy a lie to you.” 
27:15 , “and they prophesy falsely in My Name, with the result that I will drive you out, and that you will perish—you and the prophets that prophesy to you.” 
27:16 ’s House will now shortly be brought back from Babylon’—for they prophesy a lie to you. 
27:17 Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and live. Why should this city become a ruin? 
27:18 , in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, would not go to Babylon.” 
27:19  concerning the pillars, the sea, the bases, and the rest of the vessels that remain in this city, 
27:20 which King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has not taken, when he carried away captive Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem, 
27:21 , in the house of the king of Judah and at Jerusalem: 
27:22 —“and bring them up and restore them to this place.” 
28:1  and of all the people, saying, 
28:2 , the God of Israel, saying: “I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon! 
28:3 ’s House that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and brought to Babylon. 
28:4 —“for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.” 
28:5 ’s House. 
28:6 ’s House and all those who are taken away captive, from Babylon to this place! 
28:7 Yet hear now this word that I am speaking in your ears and in the ears of all the people. 
28:8 The prophets who have been before me and before you of ancient times prophesied against many countries and against great kingdoms—of war, catastrophe and plague. 
28:9  has truly sent.” 
28:10 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke-bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck and broke it. 
28:11 : “Just so I will break the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon from off the neck of all the nations within two full years.” So the prophet Jeremiah went his way. 
28:12  came to Jeremiah after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke-bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying: 
28:13 : ‘You have broken the yoke-bars of wood—but in its place you will make yoke-bars of iron.’” 
28:14 , the God of Israel: “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, so that they may serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. They will serve him, and I have also given him the beasts of the field.” 
28:15  has not sent you, yet you have caused this people to trust in a lie. 
28:16 .” 
28:17 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
29:1 , the prophets and to all the people Nebuchadnezzar had carried off captive from Jerusalem to Babylon 
29:2 (after Jeconiah the king, the queen-mother, the officers, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen and the smiths, had to leave Jerusalem). The letter was sent 
29:3 by the hand of Elasah son of Shaphan, and Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom King Zedekiah of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying, 
29:4 , the God of Israel, to all those in captivity, whom I removed as captives into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: 
29:5 “Build houses and live in them; also plant gardens and eat their fruit; 
29:6 take wives and have sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply there, and do not decrease. 
29:7 .” 
29:8 , the God of Israel: “Do not let your prophets who are among you or your diviners beguile you, and pay no attention to the dreams which you make them keep dreaming. 
29:9 . 
29:10 : “After 70 years for Babylon are complete, I will visit you, and fulfill My good word toward you—to bring you back to this place. 
29:11  and not calamity—to give you a future and a hope. 
29:12 “Then you will call on Me, and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. 
29:13 You will seek Me and find Me, when you will search for Me with all your heart. 
29:14 , “and I will bring you back to the place from which I removed you as captives into exile.” 
29:15  has raised up prophets for us in Babylon.” 
29:16  about the king who sits on the throne of David and about all the people who dwell in this city, your kinsmen who did not go with you into captivity, 
29:17 : “I am about to send on them the sword, famine and pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad. 
29:18 I will pursue them with the sword, famine and pestilence, and will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth—a curse and an astonishment, a hissing and a disgrace—among all the nations where I have driven them, 
29:19 . 
29:20 , all you of the exile whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon,” 
29:21 , the God of Israel, “concerning Ahab son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in My name: I will soon deliver them into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon—and he will slay them before your eyes. 
29:22  make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire’—
29:23 . 
29:24 Now concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you will surely say, 
29:25 , saying: 
29:26  for every madman prophesying and so that you will put him in the stocks and iron collar. 
29:27 So now, why haven’t you rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself out to be a prophet to you? 
29:28 For he has sent word to us in Babylon, saying: “The exile will be long—build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their fruit.’” 
29:29  read this letter in the ears of the prophet Jeremiah. 
29:30  came to Jeremiah, saying: 
29:31  concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: “Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, though I did not send him, and he has caused you to trust in a lie,” 
29:32 .”
30:1 , saying: 
30:2 , the God of Israel: “Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a scroll. 
30:3 . “I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they will possess it.”
30:4  spoke to Israel and to Judah. 
30:5 . 
30:6 Ask now, and see whether a man can give birth. Why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, like a woman giving birth? Why have all faces turned pale? 
30:7  ! For that day is monumental. There will be none like it— a time of trouble for Jacob! Yet out of it he will be saved.
30:8 — “that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and will tear off your bonds. Foreigners will no longer enslave him. 
30:9  their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them. 
30:10 , “nor be dismayed, O Israel, for behold, I will save you from afar, your seed from the land of their exile. Jacob will again be quiet and at ease, and no one will make him afraid. 
30:11 , “to save you, for I will make a full end of all the nations where I scatter you. but I will not make a full end of you. For I will discipline you justly, but will not leave you unpunished.” 
30:12 : “Your hurt is incurable, and your wound is severe. 
30:13 No one pleads your cause, for there is no remedy for your wound, no healing for you. 
30:14 All your lovers have forgotten you. They are not looking for you. For I wounded you as an enemy— with cruel punishment— because your iniquity is vast, your sins innumerable. 
30:15 Why cry about your fracture? Your pain has no cure. Because your iniquity is vast, your sins innumerable, I did these things to you. 
30:16 Yet all who devour you will be devoured, and all your foes—all of them— will go into captivity. Those plundering you will be plundered, and all preying on you I give as prey. 
30:17 . “For they called you an outcast: ‘Zion—no one cares about her.’” 
30:18 , “Indeed, I will return Jacob’s tents from exile, and have compassion on his dwellings. The city will be rebuilt on her mound. The citadel will stand in its rightful place. 
30:19 Out of them will come thanksgiving and the sound of celebration. I will multiply them, so they will not decrease. I will also honor them, so they will not be insignificant. 
30:20 His children also will be as formerly —his community set up before Me— and I will punish all his oppressors. 
30:21 . 
30:22 “So you will be My people, and I will be your God.” 
30:23 ! Fury has burst out as a churning storm, whirling about the head of the wicked. 
30:24 ’s fierce anger will not turn back until He has done it, until He fulfills the purposes of His heart. in the last days you will understand it.
31:1 : “The people surviving the sword found grace in the wilderness— where I gave Israel rest.” 
31:2  appeared to me.” “Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love. Therefore I have drawn you with lovingkindness. 
31:3 Again I will build you, so you will be rebuilt, virgin Israel! Again you will take up your tambourines as ornaments, and go out to dances of merrymakers. 
31:4 Again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria— planters will plant and use them. 
31:5  our God.’” 
31:6 , save your people, the remnant of Israel!’ 
31:7 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and I will gather them from the ends of the earth— among them the blind and the lame, the pregnant together with she who is in labor with child. A great throng will return here. 
31:8 With weeping and supplications they will come. I will bring them, leading them to walk by streams of water on a straight path where they will not stumble. For I am Israel’s father, and Ephraim is My firstborn.” 
31:9 , O nations, and declare it in the distant islands, and say: ‘He who scattered Israel will gather and watch over him, as a shepherd does his flock.’ 
31:10  has ransomed Jacob. He redeemed him from the hand of one stronger than he. 
31:11 — over the grain, the wine, the oil, and the young of the flock. Their life will be like a watered garden, and they will never languish again. 
31:12 Then will the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old men together. For I will turn their mourning into joy, and I will comfort them, and make them rejoice out of their sorrow. 
31:13 .
31:14 : “A voice is heard in Ramah —lamentation and bitter weeping— Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted for her children, because they are no more.” 
31:15 — “when they will return from the land of the enemy. 
31:16 — “when your children will return to their own territory. 
31:17  my God. 
31:18 For after I returned, I repented, and after that I was instructed, I struck my thigh— I was ashamed and also humiliated, for I bore the disgrace of my youth.’ 
31:19 . 
31:20 Erect road markers, set up signposts! Set your heart toward the highway, the way by which you traveled! Return, O virgin Israel, return to your cities. 
31:21  has created a new thing on earth: a woman surrounds a man. 
31:22  bless you, O dwelling of righteousness, O mountain of holiness.’ 
31:23 Judah and all its cities will dwell there together—the farmer and those who go about with flocks. 
31:24 For I will satisfy the weary soul, and every languishing soul will refresh.” 
31:25 At this point I awoke, and looked around, and my sleep was sweet to me. 
31:26 —“when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast. 
31:27 . 
31:28 “In those days they will no longer say: ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are blunted.’ 
31:29 Rather each will die for his own iniquity: if anyone eats the sour grapes, his own teeth will be blunted.”
31:30 — “when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah— 
31:31 . 
31:32  within them. Yes, I will write it on their heart. I will be their God and they will be My people. 
31:33 . “For I will forgive their iniquity, their sin I will remember no more.” 
31:34  is His Name: 
31:35 — “then also might Israel’s offspring cease from being a nation before Me—for all time.” 
31:36 . 
31:37 , from the tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. 
31:38 The measuring line will go out farther, straight to the Gareb Hill, then turn to Goah. 
31:39 . It will never be uprooted or thrown down again—forever.”
31:40
32:1 , in the tenth year of King Zedekiah of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. 
32:2 Now at the time the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the palace of the king of Judah. 
32:3 : ‘I will soon give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will take it; 
32:4 and King Zedekiah of Judah will not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but will surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and will speak with him mouth to mouth and his eyes will behold his eyes; 
32:5 —though you fight with the Chaldeans, you will not succeed?” 
32:6  came to me, saying: 
32:7 ‘Hanamel, son of Shallum your uncle, will soon come to you saying: ‘Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.’” 
32:8 . 
32:9 So I bought the field that was in Anathoth from the son of my uncle Hanamel, and weighed him the money—seventeen shekels of silver. 
32:10 I signed and sealed the deed, called in witnesses, and weighed the money on the scales. 
32:11 Then I took the purchase deed, both the sealed copy, containing the terms and conditions, and the open copy, 
32:12 and I gave the purchase deed to Baruch son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my uncle’s son Hanamel and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the purchase deed, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard. 
32:13 Then I charged Baruch before them, saying, 
32:14 , the God of Israel, “Take these deeds—this purchase deed, both the sealed copy and the open copy—and put them in a clay jar, so they may last many days.” 
32:15 , the God of Israel: “Houses and fields and vineyards will yet again be bought in this land.” 
32:16 , saying: 
32:17 ! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm—nothing is too hard for You! 
32:18  is His Name! 
32:19 Great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of men, to give each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds. 
32:20 You set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and even to this day in Israel and among mankind, and made Yourself a Name, as to this day. 
32:21 You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror. 
32:22 You gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
32:23 . They have done nothing of all you commanded them to do. Therefore you caused all this evil to fall on them. 
32:24 Look, the siege ramps have just come up to the city to take it. The city has been handed over to the Chaldeans fighting against it, because of the sword, the famine and the pestilence. What You have spoken has happened. Here it is, You see it. 
32:25 : ‘Buy for yourself the field for money and call in witnesses’—even as the city is handed over to the Chaldeans.” 
32:26  to Jeremiah, saying: 
32:27 , the God of all flesh; is there anything too hard for Me?” 
32:28 : “I am about to give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans and Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will take it. 
32:29 Then the Chaldeans fighting against this city will come and set this city on fire and burn it, with the houses—where they burned incense to Baal on their roofs and poured out drink-offerings to other gods, to provoke Me. 
32:30 . 
32:31 “Indeed this city has caused My anger and of My fury from the day that they built it up to this day, so that I will remove it from before My face, 
32:32 , their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
32:33 “They have turned their back to Me and not their face. Though I taught them early and often, they have not listened to receive instruction. 
32:34 Instead they set up their abominations in the House where My Name is called, to defile it. 
32:35 They built the high places of Baal in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, to make their sons and their daughters pass through fire to Molech—something I never commanded them, nor did it enter My mind that they would do this loathsome thing, causing Judah to sin.” 
32:36 , the God of Israel, concerning this city, about which you say, “It is handed over to the king of Babylon by the sword, famine, and pestilence. 
32:37 “See, I will gather them out of all the countries, where I have driven them in My anger, My fury, and great wrath, and I will bring them back to this place and cause them to dwell securely. 
32:38 They will be My people, and I will be their God. 
32:39 I will give them one heart and one way, so they may fear Me forever; for their good and for their children after them. 
32:40 I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never turn away from doing good for them. I will put My fear in their hearts, so that they will not depart from Me. 
32:41 “Yes, I will delight in doing good for them, and with all My heart and all My soul I will in truth plant them in this land.” 
32:42 : “Just as I have brought all this great evil on this people, so I will bring on them all the good that I have promised them. 
32:43 So fields will be bought in this land, about which you are saying: ‘It will be a desolation, without man or beast; it is handed over to the Chaldeans.’ 
32:44 . 
33:1  came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still confined in the guard’s courtyard, saying: 
33:2  is His Name. 
33:3 “Call to Me, and I will answer you— I will tell you great and hidden things, which you do not know.” 
33:4 , the God of Israel: “Concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are torn down against the siege ramps and against the sword, 
33:5 they are coming to fight with the Chaldeans, but they are about to fill them with the dead bodies of the people whom I will slay in My anger and in My fury. I have hidden My face from this city because of all their wickedness. 
33:6  and truth. 
33:7 I will restore Judah from exile and Israel from exile, and will rebuild them, as in former times. 
33:8 I will also cleanse them from all their iniquity in which they have sinned against Me, and I will pardon all their wrongs in which they have sinned against Me and in which they have rebelled against Me. 
33:9  that I do for it.”
33:10 : “Yet again in this place—which you are saying is a waste without man or beast, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem the desolate, without man, without inhabitant and without beast—there will be heard 
33:11 . 
33:12 : “Yet again will there be in this place, which is waste, without man and without beast, and in all its cities, a pasture of shepherds making their flocks lie down. 
33:13 .
33:14 — “when I will fulfill the good word I spoke concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah. 
33:15 In those days and at that time, I will cause a Branch of Righteousness to spring up for David, and He will execute justice and righteousness in the land. 
33:16  our Righteousness.” 
33:17 : “For David, there will not be cut off a man sitting on the throne of the house of Israel, 
33:18  ever lack a man before Me to offer burnt offering, to burn grain offerings and to make sacrifices continually.” 
33:19  came to Jeremiah, saying, 
33:20 : “If you can break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night, so that day and night would not be at in their appointed time, 
33:21  would not be My ministers. 
33:22 As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea measured, so I will multiply the offspring of David My servant, and the Levites who minister to Me.” 
33:23  came to Jeremiah, saying: 
33:24  did choose, He has rejected them’? Thus they despise My people—no longer a nation before them.” 
33:25 : “If I have not made My covenant of day and night firm, and the fixed patterns ordering the heavens and earth, 
33:26 only then would I reject the offspring of Jacob, and of My servant David so that I would not take from his offspring rulers over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore them from their exile, and have compassion on them.”
34:1 , when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion and all the peoples were warring against Jerusalem and its towns, saying, 
34:2 : ‘I am about to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire, 
34:3 and you will not escape out of his hand, but will surely be captured and given into his hand. Your eyes will behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he will speak with you mouth to mouth, and you will go to Babylon.” 
34:4  concerning you: “You will not die by the sword; 
34:5 .
34:6 Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke all these words to King Zedekiah of Judah in Jerusalem, 
34:7 when the army of the king of Babylon was warring against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left—against Lachish and against Azekah, for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities. 
34:8 , after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people that were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them, 
34:9 so that everyone should let his manservant and his maidservant—Hebrew man or Hebrew woman—go free, so that no one should make a slave of a Jew, his brother. 
34:10 So all the princes and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant, that everyone would free his manservant and his maidservant and not make them slaves any more—they obeyed, and freed them. 
34:11 But afterward they turned around and made the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, return, and brought them back into subjection as servants and as handmaids.” 
34:12 , saying, 
34:13 , the God of Israel: “I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying: 
34:14 ‘At the end of seven years you are to set free every man his brother that is a Hebrew who has been sold to you and has served you six years; you are let him go free from you.’ But your fathers did not obey Me, nor inclined their ear. 
34:15 Now you had repented, and had done that which is right in My eyes, by proclaiming liberty everyone to his neighbor. You even had made a covenant before Me in the House where My Name is called. 
34:16 But you turned around and profaned My Name, and made everyone his servant and his handmaid, whom you had let go free at their will, return, and you brought them back into subjection, to be your servants and handmaids.” 
34:17 , “to the sword, to plague and to famine! So I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. 
34:18 I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts
34:19 , and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf—
34:20 I will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them who seek their life, and their dead bodies will be for food to the birds of the sky and to the beasts of the earth. 
34:21 King Zedekiah of Judah and his princes I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them who seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, who were withdrawing from you. 
34:22 , “and cause them to return to this city. They will fight against it, capture it, and burn it down with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a wasteland, with no one living.”
35:1  in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying: 
35:2 , and give them wine to drink.” 
35:3 So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, his brothers and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites, 
35:4  to the chamber of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah the man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum, the doorkeeper. 
35:5 I set jars full of wine and cups before the sons of the house of the Rechabites, and said to them: “Drink wine!” 
35:6 But they said: “We drink no wine, for Jonadab son of Rechab our father commanded us: ‘You will drink no wine, not you nor your sons, forever. 
35:7 Also you are not to build a house, or sow seed, or plant a vineyard or own one. Instead all your days you are to dwell in tents, so that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.’ 
35:8 So we obeyed the voice of Jonadab son of Rechab our father in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters, 
35:9 nor to build houses for us to dwell in, nor to own a vineyard, field or seed, 
35:10 and we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. 
35:11 But when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up against the land, we said: ‘Come, let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and for fear of the army of the Arameans. So we are dwelling in Jerusalem.” 
35:12  to Jeremiah, saying, 
35:13 . 
35:14 “The words of Jonadab son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are observed, and to this day they drink none, for they listen to their father’s commandment. Yet I have spoken to you, early and often, and you have not obeyed Me. 
35:15 “I have sent also to you all My servants the prophets, sending them early and often, saying: ‘Return you now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and you will dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers; but you have not inclined your ear, nor listened to Me. 
35:16 For the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab have kept the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people have not obeyed Me.’” 
35:17 , the God of Israel: “I am about to bring on Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them, because I spoke to them but they have not heard, and I have called to them but they have not answered.” 
35:18 , the God of Israel: “Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he commanded you,” 
35:19 , the God of Israel: “There will never be cut off for Jonadab son of Rechab a man to stand before Me forever.”
36:1 , saying: 
36:2  scroll, and write in it all the words that I have spoken to you about Israel, about Judah, and about all the nations from the day I spoke to you—from the days of Josiah until this day. 
36:3 Perhaps the house of Judah will hear all the calamity that I am planning to do to them, in order that they may turn, each one from his evil way. Then I would forgive their iniquity and their sin.” 
36:4  scroll. 
36:5 . 
36:6 , on a fast day. You should also read them in the ears of all Judah coming from their towns. 
36:7  has pronounced against this people.” 
36:8 . 
36:9 —all the people in Jerusalem and all the people that came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem. 
36:10 , in the ears of all the people. 
36:11 , 
36:12 he went down to the scribe’s chamber of the king’s palace. All the officials sat there—the scribe Elishama, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the officials. 
36:13 Then Micaiah reported to them all the words that he had heard Baruch reading out of the scroll in the ears of the people. 
36:14  in his hand and went to them. 
36:15 Then they said to him: “Sit down now, and read it in our ears.” So Baruch read it in their ears. 
36:16 After they had heard all the words, they turned to each other in fear, then said to Baruch: “We will surely report all these words to the king.” 
36:17 They also asked Baruch, saying: “Tell us now, how did you write all these words? At his dictation?” 
36:18 Then Baruch answered them: “He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink into the scroll.” 
36:19 Then the officials said to Baruch: “Go, hide yourself—you and Jeremiah—and let no one know where you are.” 
36:20  in the chamber of the scribe Elishama. They reported all the words in the ears of the king. 
36:21  , and he brought it out of the chamber of the scribe Elishama. Jehudi read it in the ears of the king and all the officials who were standing by the king. 
36:22 Since it was the ninth month, the king was residing in the winter house, with a fireplace burning before him. 
36:23  was consumed in the fire in the fireplace. 
36:24 Yet neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words were afraid, nor tore their clothes. 
36:25  , but he would not listen to them. 
36:26  hid them. 
36:27  with the words that Baruch had written at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying: 
36:28  , and write in it all the original words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned up. 
36:29  , saying, “Why have you written in it, saying the king of Babylon will surely come and destroy this land and will bring an end to both man and beast from it?”’” 
36:30  about King Jehoiakim of Judah: “He will have no one to sit on the throne of David. Moreover, his dead body will be tossed out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night. 
36:31 I will also punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity, and I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the people of Judah all the calamity that I have pronounced against them—but they did not listen.” 
36:32  and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, who wrote in it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll which King Jehoiakim of Judah had burned up in the fire—and added to them many similar words. 
37:1 Now Zedekiah son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah son of Jehoiakim, whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon made king in the land of Judah. 
37:2  which He spoke by the prophet Jeremiah. 
37:3  our God for us.” 
37:4 Now Jeremiah was coming in and going out among the people, for they had not put him into prison. 
37:5 Meanwhile Pharaoh’s army had set out of Egypt, and when the Chaldeans besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they lifted the siege from Jerusalem. 
37:6  to the prophet Jeremiah, saying. 
37:7 , the God of Israel, thus will you say to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: “Now, Pharaoh’s army, which is come forth to help you, will return to Egypt into their own land. 
37:8 The Chaldeans will return and fight against this city. Then they will capture it and burn it with fire.” 
37:9 : “Do not deceive yourselves, saying: ‘The Chaldeans will surely depart from us’—for they will not depart. 
37:10 For even if you had struck down the entire Chaldean army fighting against you, and there were left among them only wounded men, each in his tent, they would get up and burn this city down with fire.” 
37:11 So it came to pass, when the army of the Chaldeans went up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army, 
37:12 that Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to claim his property there among the people. 
37:13 But when he was at the Benjamin Gate, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah son of Hananiah, who arrested the prophet Jeremiah, saying: “You are deserting to the Chaldeans!” 
37:14 But Jeremiah said, “That’s a lie! I am not deserting to the Chaldeans!” But Irijah would not listen to him, but arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. 
37:15 The officials were angry with Jeremiah, had him beaten, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe, for they had made that the prison. 
37:16 For Jeremiah went into a vaulted cell in the dungeon pit, and Jeremiah remained there many days. 
37:17 ?” “There is,” Jeremiah said, and he also said, “You shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon.” 
37:18 Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah: “How have I sinned against you or against your servants or against this people, that you have put me in prison? 
37:19 Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying: ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land?’ 
37:20 So now please listen, my lord the king! Please let my petition come before you and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, so I will not die there.” 
37:21 Then Zedekiah the king gave a command, and they committed Jeremiah into the courtyard of the guard. They gave him a loaf of bread from the bakers’ street daily, until all the bread in the city was spent. So Jeremiah stayed in the guard’s courtyard. 
38:1 Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying,
38:2 : “He that remains in this city will die by the sword, by famine, and by plague, but anyone who goes out to the Chaldeans will live—so he will keep his life like the spoils of war, and will live.” 
38:3 : “This city will surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.” 
38:4  of this people, but calamity.” 
38:5 Then King Zedekiah said: “Here he is in your hand. For the king cannot do anything against you.” 
38:6 So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern-pit of Malchiah the king’s son, which was in the courtyard of the guard, lowering Jeremiah down with ropes. Now in the pit there was no water, but only mud, and Jeremiah sank into the mud. 
38:7 Now Ebed-melech—an Ethiopian official in the king’s palace—heard they had put Jeremiah in the pit. While the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate, 
38:8 Ebed-melech went out from the king’s palace and spoke to the king, saying: 
38:9 “My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they cast into the pit. He is likely to die right where he is from hunger, for there is no more bread in the city.” 
38:10 Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying: “Take thirty men from here with you, and bring the prophet Jeremiah up out of the cistern, before he dies.” 
38:11 So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went into the king’s palace under the storehouse, from there he took worn-out clothes and worn-out rags, and lowered them by ropes into the cistern-pit to Jeremiah. 
38:12 And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah: “Now put these worn-out clothes and rags under your armpits under the ropes.” Jeremiah did so. 
38:13 Then they pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes, and lifted him up out of the pit. But Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard. 
38:14 . The king said to Jeremiah: “I am going to ask you something—hide nothing from me.” 
38:15 Jeremiah said to Zedekiah: “If I tell you, won’t you surely put me to death? Besides, if I give you counsel, you won’t listen to me.” 
38:16  lives, that gave us life, I will not put you to death, nor will I give you into the hand of these men seeking your life.” 
38:17 , the God of Israel: “If you will go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, then your soul will live, this city will not be burned with fire; and you and your household will survive. 
38:18 But if you do not go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, then this city will be handed over to the Chaldeans; they will burn it with fire, and you will not escape out of their hand.” 
38:19 Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah: “I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest they hand me over to them and they abuse me.” 
38:20 , in what I am speaking to you, so it will go well for you, and your soul will live! 
38:21  has shown me: 
38:22 ‘Soon, all the women who are left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officers of the king of Babylon, and those women will say: “Your close friends have misled you, and prevailed over you. Your feet are sunk in the mire, and they deserted you.’” 
38:23 “Then they will bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans, and you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned down with fire.” 
38:24 Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah: “Let no one know of these words, and you will not die. 
38:25 “But if the officials hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you and say to you: ‘Tell us now what you have said to the king—hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death. And what did the king say to you?’ 
38:26 Then you will tell them, ‘I was presenting my petition before the king, not to make me return to Jonathan’s house to die there.’” 
38:27 When all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, he told them with just these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him, since the matter was not overheard. 
38:28 Then Jeremiah stayed in the guard’s courtyard until the day that Jerusalem was captured.
39:1 Now when Jerusalem was captured, in the ninth year of King Zedekiah of Judah, in the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and all his army advanced against Jerusalem, and besieged it. 
39:2 On the ninth day of the fourth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the city wall was broken through. 
39:3 Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-sarezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sarezer the Rab-mag, and all the rest of the officials of Babylon’s king. 
39:4 Now when King Zedekiah of Judah and all the men of war saw them, they fled. They went out of the city at night, by way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls, heading out toward the way of the Arabah. 
39:5 But the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. When they captured him, they brought him up to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he passed judgment on him. 
39:6 The king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes. Moreover, the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah. 
39:7 Then he blinded Zedekiah’s eyes, and he bound him in shackles to carry him off to Babylon. 
39:8 Then the Chaldeans burned the king’s palace and the houses of the people with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. 
39:9 Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away into exile the rest of the people—those who remained in the city and also the deserters who had defected to him, and the rest of the people remaining. 
39:10 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the people, who had nothing, behind in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields in that day.
39:11 Now King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon gave orders about Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying: 
39:12 “Take him, and look after him, and do no harm to him; rather, do to him just as he tells you.” 
39:13 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent word, so Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sarezer the Rab-mag and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon 
39:14 sent and brought Jeremiah out of the guard’s courtyard, and gave him to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, to take him home. So he dwelt among the people. 
39:15  came to Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the guard’s courtyard, saying, 
39:16 , the God of Israel: ‘Listen, I will bring about My words on this city for evil and not for good. They will happen before you in that day. 
39:17 —and you will not be given into the hand of the men whom you dread. 
39:18 .
40:1 , after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had released him from Ramah. He had taken him bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, who were being exiled to Babylon. 
40:2  your God pronounced this evil against this place, 
40:3  and have not listened to His voice, this thing has happened to you. 
40:4 But now behold, I am freeing you this day from the chains that are on your hand. If it is good in your eyes to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you. But if it is evil in your eyes to come with me to Babylon, stop. Look, the whole land is before you—wherever it seems good and right to you to go, there go.” 
40:5 But he would not turn back. “Go back then to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go anywhere it seems right in your eyes to go.” Then the captain of the guard gave him a ration and a gift, and let him go. 
40:6 So Jeremiah went to the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.
40:7 Now all the commanders of the forces that were in the field—they and their men—heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam over the land, and had put him in charge of the men, and women and children, the poorest of the land who were not carried away captive to Babylon. 
40:8 So they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—including Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite—they and their men. 
40:9 Then Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying: “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well for you. 
40:10 As for me, look, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who come to us. But as for you, gather wine, summer fruit and oil, and put them in your jars, and dwell in your cities that you have taken over.” 
40:11 Also when all the Jews who were in Moab, among Ammon’s children, in Edom, and in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had appointed over them Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, 
40:12 then all the Jews returned out of all places where they had been driven, and came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruit in great abundance. 
40:13 Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were in the field came to Gedaliah to Mizpah 
40:14 and said to him, “Are you aware that Baalis the king of Ammon’s children has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them. 
40:15 Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke privately to Gedaliah at Mizpah, saying, “Let me go now, and I will slay Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life, so that all the Jews that are gathered to you would be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?’ 
40:16 But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Don’t do this thing! For what you are saying about Ishmael is a lie.”
41:1 Now it was in the seventh month, that Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama—of royal descent and one of the chief officers of the king, along with ten men—came to Gedaliah son of Ahikam to Mizpah. While they were eating bread there together in Mizpah, 
41:2 Ishmael son of Nethaniah rose up with the ten men that were with him and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan with the sword—putting to death the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land. 
41:3 Ishmael also slew all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Chaldean soldiers who were found there. 
41:4 Now it was the next day after he had slain Gedaliah, when no one knew about it, 
41:5 . 
41:6 So Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went, and as he came to meet them, he said to them: “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.” 
41:7 Yet it was that as soon as they came within of the city that Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them within the cistern-pit. 
41:8 However ten men were found among them that said to Ishmael: “Don’t kill us! For we have hidden stores in the field—wheat, barley, oil and honey!” So he held off and did not kill them along with their companions. 
41:9 Now the cistern where Ishmael cast all the corpses of the men whom he killed, because they were on Gedaliah’s side, was the one which King Asa had made for fear of King Baasa of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain. 
41:10 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the rest of the people that were in Mizpah, including the king’s daughters—all the people who were left in Mizpah over whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had put under the charge of Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and set off to cross over to Ammon’s children. 
41:11 But Johanan son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces that were with him heard about all the evil that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done. 
41:12 So they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great pool in Gibeon. 
41:13 Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him, they were glad. 
41:14 So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went over to Johanan son of Kareah. 
41:15 But Ishmael son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to Ammon’s children. 
41:16 Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him took all the remnant of the people whom he had rescued from Ishmael son of Nethaniah from Mizpah, after he had murdered Gedaliah son of Ahikam—the men, the soldiers, women, children, and court officials whom he had brought back from Gibeon—
41:17 and they left and stayed at Chimham’s lodge, which is near Beth-lehem, in order to go on to enter Egypt, 
41:18 away from the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them, since Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land. 
42:1 Then all the commanders of the forces, Johanan son of Kareah, Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, approached 
42:2  your God on our behalf, for all this remnant—for we who are left are but a few out of many, as you are seeing with your own eyes—
42:3  your God may tell us the way we should go and what we should do.” 
42:4  will answer you, I will declare it to you—I will not keep a word from you.” 
42:5  your God sends you to us. 
42:6  our God.” 
42:7  came to Jeremiah. 
42:8 Then he called Johanan son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces that were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest, 
42:9 , the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before Him: 
42:10 ‘If you will still stay in this land, then will I build you up and not tear you down, and I will plant you and not uproot you. For I will relent concerning the calamity that I have done to you. 
42:11 —“for I am with you to save you, and deliver you from his hand. 
42:12 I will also show you compassion and he will have compassion on you, and restore you to your own soil. 
42:13  your God, 
42:14  or hunger for food, and live there’ 
42:15 , the God of Israel: If you really set your faces to enter Egypt, and go to sojourn there, 
42:16 then it will come to pass that the sword, which you fear will overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine about which you are anxious will follow hard after you there in Egypt—and there you will die. 
42:17 So will it be for all the people who set their faces to enter Egypt to sojourn there—they will die by the sword, by famine and by plague. So none of them will remain or escape from the calamity that I will bring on them.’” 
42:18 , the God of Israel: “As My anger and My fury were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so will My fury be poured out on you, if you will enter Egypt. You will be an execration, a horror, a curse, and a disgrace, and you will never see this place again.” 
42:19  has spoken concerning you, O remnant of Judah: “Do not go to Egypt. Know for sure that I have forewarned you this day! 
42:20  our God will say, so declare to us, and we will do it. 
42:21  your God in anything for which He has sent me to you. 
42:22 Now therefore know for sure that you will die by the sword, by famine, and by plague, in the place whither you desired to go to sojourn there.”
43:1  their God had sent him to them—
43:2  our God has not sent you to say. ‘You must not go to Egypt to sojourn there.’ 
43:3 Rather, Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us, to give us over into the hand of the Chaldeans, so they may put us to death or carry us away as captives to Babylon!” 
43:4 , to stay in the land of Judah. 
43:5 But Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took the entire remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations where they had been driven to dwell in the land of Judah—
43:6 the men, the women, the children, the king’s daughters, everyone that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, as well as Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah—
43:7 . When they arrived at Tahpanhes 
43:8  came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, 
43:9 “Take some large stones in your hand and hide them in the mortar in the brickwork at the entrance of Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah. 
43:10 , the God of Israel: “I am about to send for and bring King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and I will set his throne over these stones where I have hid, and he will spread his royal pavilion over them. 
43:11 Yes, he will come, and will strike the land of Egypt. Those for death—to death! Those for exile—to exile! Those for the sword—to the sword! 
43:12 “I will also set fire to the houses of Egypt’s gods. He will burn them and carry them off. He will wrap himself up with the land of Egypt as a shepherd wraps himself up with his garment. Then he will depart from there victoriously. 
43:13 “He will also shatter the pillars of the temple of the sun in the land of Egypt, while houses of the gods of Egypt He will burn with fire.”
44:1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt—at Migdol, at Tahpanhes, at Noph, and in the region of Pathros, saying, 
44:2 , the God of Israel: “You have seen all the calamity that I brought on Jerusalem and on all the cities of Judah. Behold, today they are a ruin, and no one lives in them, 
44:3 because of their wickedness which they committed to provoke Me, by continuing to burn sacrifices for and serve other gods, whom they had not known—not they, nor you, nor your fathers. 
44:4 Yet I sent you all My servants the prophets, sending them early and often, saying: ‘Oh, do not do this loathsome thing that I hate.’ 
44:5 But they did not listen or incline their ear to turn from their wickedness, to stop making offering to other gods. 
44:6 “Therefore My fury and Mine anger was poured out and blazed in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. So they are waste and a ruin, as it is today. 
44:7 , the God of Israel: “Why are you committing this great evil against your own souls? You cut off from yourselves man and woman, infant and nursing child, from the midst of Judah, to leave yourself without a remnant. 
44:8 You are provoking Me with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you have come to dwell, so that you will be cut off and become a curse and a disgrace among all the nations of the earth. 
44:9 Have you forgotten the evils of your fathers, the evils of the kings of Judah, the evils of their wives, and your own evils and the evils of your wives, which were committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
44:10 , My statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.” 
44:11 , the God of Israel: “I will soon set My face against you for calamity, to cut off all Judah. 
44:12 I will take the remnant of Judah who set their faces to enter the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they will all be consumed, falling in the land of Egypt by the sword and by famine. They will die, from the least to the greatest, by the sword and by famine, and they will be an execration, and a horror, a curse, and a disgrace. 
44:13 So I will punish those dwelling in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by famine, and by plague. 
44:14 So none of the remnant of Judah entering the land of Egypt to sojourn there will escape or remain, to return to the land of Judah, when they are longing with their soul to return to live there; for none will return except as refugees.” 
44:15 Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, along with all the women that stood by—a large assembly—with all the people dwelling in Pathros in the land of Egypt, responded to Jeremiah, saying: 
44:16 , we are not going to listen to you! 
44:17 Instead we will definitely do every word as went out of our mouth—burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, just as we did, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem—for then we had plenty of food, were well off, and saw no calamity. 
44:18 But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine. 
44:19 Moreover, when we were burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, when we made cakes for her in her image and poured out drink offerings to her, were we without our husbands?” 
44:20 Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and the women, to all the people that were giving him such an answer, saying: 
44:21  did remember them, they did come into His heart. 
44:22  could no longer endure it, because of the evil of your deeds, because of the abominations that you committed! So your land has become a wasteland, a desolation and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day. 
44:23 , nor in His statutes, nor in His testimonies—that is why this calamity has befallen you, as it is this day.” 
44:24 , all Judah that are in the land of Egypt. 
44:25 , the God of Israel, saying: ‘You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths and fulfilled it with your hands, saying: “We will definitely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink-offerings to her.” You surely will confirm your vows and surely will perform your vows!’” 
44:26  lives.’ 
44:27 Here I am, watching over them for evil, and not for good. All the people of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will be consumed by the sword and by famine, until there is an end of them. 
44:28 . 
44:29 “Moreover, this will be the sign to you: I will visit punishment on you in this place, so that you may know that My words will surely stand against you as calamity.” 
44:30 : “Soon, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them who seek his life, just as I gave King Zedekiah of Judah into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, his enemy who was seeking his life.”
45:1 The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a scroll from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying, 
45:2 , the God of Israel, concerning you, Baruch: “you said: 
45:3  has added sorrow to my pain. I am worn out with my groaning, and I find no rest.’” 
45:4 : “Behold, what I have built I will tear down, and what I have planted I will uproot—the whole land. 
45:5 —“but I will grant you your soul as spoil in all places where you may go.”
46:1  that came to the prophet Jeremiah concerning the nations. 
46:2 For Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah. 
46:3 “Arrange breastplate and shield! Advance to battle! 
46:4 Harness the horses and mount, O horsemen! Take your position, with helmets! Polish the spears! Put on armor! 
46:5 . 
46:6 “The swift cannot flee, nor the warrior escape. In the north by the river Euphrates They stumbled and fell. 
46:7 Who is this, rising like the Nile, like the rivers whose waters churn? 
46:8 Egypt rises like the Nile, like the rivers whose waters churn. He says: ‘I will rise up, I will cover the earth, I will destroy the city and its inhabitants!’ 
46:9 Prance, you horses, and rush madly, you chariots. Let the warriors go out— Cush and Put grasping the shield, Lydians grasping and bending the bow! 
46:10 , in the northern land by the river Euphrates. 
46:11 Go up into Gilead and get balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt. In vain you use many medicines— there is no cure for you. 
46:12 Nations have heard of your shame, and your outcry fills the earth. For warrior stumbles over warrior— both fall down together.” 
46:13  spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon to strike the land of Egypt: 
46:14 “Declare it in Egypt, proclaim in Migdol, and announce in Noph and Tahpanhes. Say: ‘Stand up and get ready! For the sword has devoured all around you. 
46:15  thrust him down. 
46:16 They keep stumbling, yes, falling over each other. Then they said: ‘Get up! Let’s return to our own people, to the land of our birth, away from the oppressor’s sword.’ 
46:17 They cried there: ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise! He let the opportune time pass.’ 
46:18 — “like Tabor among the mountains, or like Carmel by the sea, so surely he will come.” 
46:19 O daughter dwelling in Egypt, get your bags ready for exile! For Noph will become a ruin laid waste, uninhabited. 
46:20 Egypt is a beautiful heifer— but a biting fly is coming— from the north it is coming! 
46:21 Even her mercenaries among her are like stall-fed calves, for they also will turn back— they will flee away together, they will not stand up— for the day of their calamity has come upon them, the time of their visitation. 
46:22 Its sound will hiss like a snake, as they march with an army, and come against her as woodcutters with axes. 
46:23 — “though it was impenetrable, for they are worse than the locust —they are without number. 
46:24 The daughter of Egypt is disgraced, handed over to people of the north.” 
46:25 , the God of Israel, says: “Behold, I will punish Amon of No, Pharaoh, Egypt, with her gods and her kings—even Pharaoh, and them that trust in him. 
46:26 . 
46:27 “But you, fear not, Jacob My servant, nor be dismayed, O Israel. For behold, I will save you from afar, your offspring from the land of their exile. And Jacob will return and be at peace and secure, no one frightening him. 
46:28 — “for I am with you. I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you, but I will not make a full end of you. I will discipline you with justice, but will not utterly destroy you.”
47:1  that came to the prophet Jeremiah concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh struck Gaza. 
47:2 : “Look, waters rising from the north will become an overflowing torrent, and overflow the land and all in it, the city and those dwelling in it and the men will cry, and every inhabitant of the land wail. 
47:3 The noise— the stomping hooves of his stallions, the rumbling of his chariots, the reverberation of his wheels! Fathers will not turn back for their children because of their limp hands. 
47:4  will destroy the Philistines, the rest of the island of Caphtor. 
47:5 Baldness has come upon Gaza, Ashkelon is ruined. O remnant of their valley, how long will you gash yourself? 
47:6 , how long until you are quiet? Go back into your sheath, rest and be still. 
47:7  has commanded? He has assigned it against Ashkelon and against the coast of the sea. 
48:1  to Nebo! For it will be ravaged. Kiriathaim will be disgraced and captured. The fortress will be shamed, shattered. 
48:2 There is no more praise for Moab. In Heshbon they plotted evil against her: ‘Come, let’s cut her off as a nation.’ You too, Madmen, will be silenced— the sword will chase you. 
48:3 The sound of outcry from Horonaim, devastation and great destruction! 
48:4 Moab is shattered—her little ones have raised a cry to be heard. 
48:5 For at the ascent of Luhith they go up with continual weeping. For on the descent to Horonaim they heard the foe’s shattering cry. 
48:6 Flee! Escape with your lives! Be like a tamarisk in the wilderness. 
48:7 For because of your trust in your works and your treasures, you will be captured, too. Chemosh will go into exile, together with his priests and princes. 
48:8  has said. 
48:9 Give wings to Moab, for she must fly and get away. Her cities will become a wasteland, with no one living in them. 
48:10  with slackness, and cursed is the one who withholds his sword from blood. 
48:11 Moab has been at ease since his youth. He has settled like wine on its dregs. He has not been emptied from jar to jar, nor gone into exile. Therefore he retains his flavor, and his aroma has not changed. 
48:12 — “when I will send to him those who will tip him up and over, and they will empty his vessels, and smash his jars in pieces. 
48:13 So Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh just as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence. 
48:14 How can you say: ‘We are warriors and men valiant for battle’? 
48:15 . 
48:16 “Moab’s calamity will come soon, and his downfall hastens swiftly. 
48:17 Mourn for him, all who are around him, all who know his name. Say: ‘How the mighty scepter, the splendid rod, is broken!’ 
48:18 O daughter dwelling in Dibon come down from your glory and sit in thirst! For Moab’s destroyer has come to you. He has devastated your strongholds. 
48:19 O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the road and watch— ask him fleeing and her escaping, ‘What has happened?’ 
48:20 Moab is disgraced, indeed shattered. Wail and shriek! Declare by the Arnon, Moab is ruined! 
48:21 Judgment has come on the tableland —on Holon, Jahzah, Mephaath, 
48:22 on Dibon, Nebo, Beth-diblathaim, 
48:23 on Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, Beth-meon, 
48:24 on Kerioth, Bozrah, and all the towns of the land of Moab, far and near. 
48:25 . 
48:26 . So Moab will wallow in his vomit and also become a laughingstock. 
48:27 After all, Israel is a laughingstock to you. Was he ever found among thieves, that whenever you speak of him, you should wag the head? 
48:28 Inhabitants of Moab, leave the towns and dwell in crags— like a dove nesting in a cave’s mouth. 
48:29 We have heard of the pride of Moab —very proud he is—his haughtiness, his arrogance, his insolence, and his self-exalted heart. 
48:30 , “but it is dishonest— his boasts really accomplish nothing. 
48:31 Therefore I wail for Moab! Yes, I cry out for all Moab, for the men of Kir-heres I moan. 
48:32 More than weeping of Jazer will I weep for you, vine of Sibmah! Your branches spread to the sea, reached as far as the sea of Jazer. On your summer fruits and your vintage the destroyer has fallen. 
48:33 So joy and gladness are taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab. I stopped wine from the winepresses. No one will tread with shouting— any shouting is not a shout of joy.” 
48:34 “From the outcry of Heshbon to Elealeh, as far as Jahaz they will raise their voice—from Zoar to Horonaim and a 3-year old heifer—for the Waters of Nimrim also will be waste. 
48:35 —“of the one offering on the high place and the one burning incense to his gods.” 
48:36 “That is why my heart is moaning like funeral flutes for Moab, and my heart moans like flutes for the people of Kir-heres. Thus the wealth he made is lost. 
48:37 For every head is bald, every beard clipped, on all the hands are gashes, and around the waist sackcloth. 
48:38 — 
48:39 “‘How shattered it is!’ they wailed! ‘How Moab turned his back in shame!’ So Moab will become a laughingstock and a horror to all around him.” 
48:40 : “Behold, he will swoop down like a vulture and spread out his wings against Moab. 
48:41 The towns are captured, the strongholds seized. The hearts of Moab’s warriors in that day will be like the heart of a woman in labor. 
48:42 . 
48:43 . 
48:44 . 
48:45 “In the shadow of Heshbon the fugitives stop, exhausted, for fire breaks out of Heshbon flame from within Sihon, and it singes the foreheads and the scalps of Moab’s noisy sons. 
48:46  to you, Moab! The people of Chemosh have perished! For your sons are taken away captive and your daughters into exile. 
48:47 . “Until then this is the judgment of Moab.”
49:1 : “Has Israel no sons? Has he no heir? Why then did Malcam dispossess Gad and his people settled in its towns? 
49:2 . 
49:3 “Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is devastated! Cry, daughters of Rabbah! Wear sackcloth, lament, and run to and fro within the walls, for Malcam will go into captivity together with his priests and princes. 
49:4 Why do you brag about valleys— your flowing valley, faithless daughter? Trusting in your treasures: ‘Who will come against me?’ 
49:5 — “from all those around you. Each of you will be banished headlong, with no one to gather the fugitives. 
49:6 . 
49:7 : “Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? Is counsel lost to the prudent? Has their wisdom vanished? 
49:8 Flee! Turn back! Stay low, inhabitants of Dedan, for I will bring Esau’s calamity on him at the time that I punish him. 
49:9 If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave gleanings? If thieves came at night, would they not destroy only enough for themselves? 
49:10 But I will strip Esau bare. I will uncover his hiding places, so he will not be able to hide himself. His offspring has been destroyed with his kinsmen and neighbors. So he is nothing. 
49:11 Leave your orphans— I will keep them alive, and let your widows trust in Me.” 
49:12 : “Behold, if those who do not deserve to drink the cup must surely drink, can you go utterly unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for you shall surely drink! 
49:13 — “that Bozrah will become a horror, a disgrace, a waste and a curse. All its towns will be ruins forever.” 
49:14 . An ambassador is sent to the nations: ‘Gather together, come against her, and rise up for war!’ 
49:15 For see, I made you least among nations, despised among men. 
49:16 . 
49:17 “Edom will become a desolation. Everyone passing by will be appalled and hiss at all its plagues. 
49:18 , “no one will live there, nor any son of man dwell there. 
49:19 Look, it is like a lion coming up from the thickets of the Jordan to a secure pasture—for abruptly I will make him run away from it. I appoint over it whomever I choose. For who is like Me? Who will summon me to court? What shepherd stands up to Me?” 
49:20  has drawn up against Edom, and His strategies that He designed against the inhabitants of Teman. Surely the least of the flock will be dragged away, Surely He will make their pasture desolate because of them. 
49:21 The earth will tremble at the noise of their downfall. The sound of their outcry will be heard at the Sea of Reeds. 
49:22 Behold, he will mount up and swoop down like an eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah. The hearts of Edom’s warriors in that day will be like a woman’s heart in her pangs. 
49:23 About Damascus: Hamath and Arpad are ashamed, for they heard bad news, They melt away; in the sea there is trouble that cannot be quiet. 
49:24 Damascus has become feeble. She turns away to flee, panic grips her, anguish and pangs have seized her, like a woman in travail. 
49:25 How is the city of praise deserted— the city of my joy? 
49:26 . 
49:27 “I will set fire to the wall of Damascus— it will devour Ben-hadad’s palaces.” 
49:28 : “Arise, go up against Kedar and devastate the children of the east. 
49:29 They will take away their tents and their flocks. They will carry away their curtains, all their gear and their camels. They will cry out against them, ‘Terror on every side!’ 
49:30 . “For King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has taken counsel against you, and devised a plan against you. 
49:31 . “They have no gates or bars; they dwell alone. 
49:32 . 
49:33 “Hazor will be a lair of jackals, a desolation forever— no one will abide there, nor any son of man dwell there.” 
49:34  that came to the prophet Jeremiah about Elam, at the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah, saying, 
49:35 : “Behold, I will break Elam’s bow— the source of their might. 
49:36 I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them to all those winds. There will be no nation where the dispersed of Elam will not go. 
49:37 , “I will send the sword after them until I have consumed them. 
49:38 . 
49:39 . 
50:1  spoke about Babylon, about the land of the Chaldeans, through Jeremiah the prophet: 
50:2 “Declare it among the nations and proclaim! Raise a banner, announce, hide nothing! Say: ‘Babylon will be captured, Bel put to shame, Merodach dismayed, her images disgraced, her idols shattered!’ 
50:3 For a nation comes up against her out of the land of the north —it will desolate her land. No one will dwell there— they have fled, gone, both man and beast.”
50:4  their God. 
50:5  in an everlasting covenant that will never be forgotten. 
50:6 My people have been lost sheep. Their shepherds led them astray. Turning around in the mountains, they went from mountain to hill, and forgot their resting place. 
50:7 , the hope of their fathers.”
50:8 “Flee from within Babylon, get out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be like he-goats before the flock. 
50:9 For I will soon stir up and bring against Babylon an alliance of great nations from the north. They will form battle lines against her, from there she will be captured. Their arrows will be like a warrior who bereaves, not returning empty. 
50:10 . 
50:11 “Because you rejoice, because you exult— you who plunder My inheritance— because you frolic like a trampling heifer and neigh like stallions, 
50:12 your mother will be utterly ashamed, she who bore you will be humiliated. Behold, the least of the nations will be a wilderness, a dry land, a desert.” 
50:13 ’s wrath, it will be uninhabited, all waste. Everyone who passes by Babylon will be appalled, hissing at all her wounds. 
50:14 . 
50:15 ’s vengeance: take vengeance on her, as she has done, do to her! 
50:16 Cut off the sower from Babylon and the one who wields a sickle in the time of harvest. Before the sword of the oppressor they will each turn to his people, each will flee to his own land. 
50:17 Israel is a scattered flock— lions have driven them away. First, Assyria’s king devoured him. This last one who broke his bones was King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. 
50:18 , the God of Israel: “Indeed, I will punish Babylon’s king and his land, just as I punished Assyria’s king. 
50:19 I will bring Israel back to his pasture. He will feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead. 
50:20 — “Israel’s guilt will be sought, but there will be none, also for the sins of Judah, but they will not be found. For I will pardon those whom I leave as a remnant. 
50:21 — “and do all that I commanded you.” 
50:22 The noise of battle is in the land and great crashing. 
50:23 How the hammer of the whole earth has been cut down and smashed! How Babylon has become a horror among the nations! 
50:24 . 
50:25  has to do in the land of Chaldea. 
50:26 Come against her from afar, open her granaries, pile her up like heaps and utterly destroy her! Let nothing be left to her. 
50:27  to them! Their day has come— the time of their visitation. 
50:28  our God, vengeance for His Temple. 
50:29 , against the Holy One of Israel. 
50:30 . 
50:31 — “for your day has come, the time when I will punish you. 
50:32 The arrogant will stumble and fall, and no one will lift him up. I will kindle fire in his cities, and it will devour all who are round about him.” 
50:33 : “The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together. All their captors hold them fast. They refused to let them go. 
50:34  is His Name— He will vigorously plead their case, so He may give rest to the earth, but trembling to the Babylonians. 
50:35 — “and on Babylon’s inhabitants, and her officials and wise men. 
50:36 A sword on the diviners—fools! A sword on her warriors—shattered! 
50:37 A sword on their horses, their chariots, on all the mixed people within her, so they will become like women! A sword on her treasures— so they may be plundered. 
50:38 A drought is on her waters, so they will be dried up. For it is a land of idols— they are mad about horrible things. 
50:39 So wildcats and hyenas will live there and ostriches settle there. It will never again be inhabited or dwelt in from generation to generation. 
50:40 — so no man will live there, nor any son of man dwell in it. 
50:41 Look! A people coming from the north, a great nation and many kings will rise up from the ends of the earth. 
50:42 They grasp bow and javelin. They are cruel, with no compassion. Their voice roars like the sea, as they ride on horses, arranged as warriors for battle, against you, daughter of Babylon. 
50:43 Babylon’s king heard news of them. His hands droop; anguish grabs him, agony like a woman in labor. 
50:44 Look, it is like a lion coming up from the thickets of the Jordan to a secure pasture—for abruptly I will make him run away from it. I appoint over it whomever I choose. For who is like Me? Who will summon Me to court? What shepherd stands up to Me?” 
50:45  has drawn up against Babylon, and His strategies that He designed against the land of the Chaldeans. Surely the least of the flock will be dragged away, Surely He will make their pasture desolate because of them. 
50:46 The earth will tremble at the noise of Babylon’s capture. The sound of their outcry will be heard among the nations. 
51:1 : “Look! Stirring up against Babylon and those living in Leb-kamai, a spirit of destruction. 
51:2 I will send strangers to Babylon to scatter her and empty her land. For in the day of trouble they will be against her all around. 
51:3 Let the archer bend his bow at her. Let him rise up at her in his armor. Do not spare her young men. Destroy her whole army. 
51:4 They will fall down slain in the land of Chaldea, thrust through in her streets. 
51:5 , though their land is full of guilt before the Holy One of Israel. 
51:6 . He will repay her recompense. 
51:7 ’s hand, intoxicating the whole earth. The nations drunk her wine— so the nations are going crazy. 
51:8 Suddenly Babylon is fallen! Shattered! Howl over her! Bring balm for her wound. Perhaps she may be healed? 
51:9 We would have healed Babylon, but she cannot be healed. Abandon her! Let’s go, each one to his own country, for her judgment has reached up to the heavens and has risen beyond the skies. 
51:10 ! 
51:11 ’s vengeance, vengeance for His Temple. 
51:12  has both planned and accomplished what He spoke about the Babylonians. 
51:13 You dwelling by many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come, the measure of your covetousness. 
51:14  has sworn by Himself: “Surely I will fill you with men like a locust swarm, and they will shout cheers over you.” 
51:15 One made the earth by His power, set up the world by His wisdom, and spread out the heavens by His knowledge. 
51:16 At His giving voice— tumult of waters in the skies! He causes clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings forth wind from His storehouses. 
51:17 All mankind is stupid, ignorant. Every goldsmith is disgraced by an idol, for his molten image is a lie— there is no breath in them. 
51:18 They are futile, a work of delusion. In the time of their visitation they will perish. 
51:19  is His Name. 
51:20 “You are My club, a war weapon— with you I shatter nations, with you I destroy kingdoms. 
51:21 With you I wreck horse and rider, with you I wreck chariot and rider, 
51:22 with you I break man and woman, with you I break elder and youth, with you I break young man and maid, 
51:23 with you I scatter shepherd and flock, with you I scatter plowman and ox-team, with you I scatter governors and officials. 
51:24 . 
51:25 — “Destroyer of all the land— I will stretch out My hand at you, roll you down from the cliffs, and make you a burning hill. 
51:26 . 
51:27  among the nations! Consecrate the nations against her. Summon against her the kingdoms— Ararat, Minni and Ashkenaz. Appoint a marshal against her. Bring horses up like rough locusts. 
51:28 Consecrate the nations against her, the kings of the Medes, its governors and all its deputies, and all the land of his dominion. 
51:29 ’s plans against Babylon arise— to make the land of Babylon a desolation without inhabitant. 
51:30 Babylon’s warriors ceased fighting. They stay in their strongholds. Their might is exhausted. They have become like women. Her dwellings are set ablaze, her gate-bars are broken. 
51:31 One runner runs to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to tell Babylon’s king that his city has been taken from end to end. 
51:32 The fords have also been seized and the marshes burned with fire, so the warriors are in panic. 
51:33 , the God of Israel: “The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at treading time. A little longer, and the time of harvest for her will come.” 
51:34 “Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured me, crushed me, set me aside like an empty dish, swallowed me up like a dragon, filled his belly with my delicacies, rinsed me away.” 
51:35 The one dwelling in Zion says: “Let the violence done to me and my flesh be upon Babylon!” Jerusalem says: “My blood be on the Chaldeans!” 
51:36 : “Yes, I will uphold your cause and take vengeance for you. I will dry up her sea, and make her fountain dry. 
51:37 Babylon will become heaps, a dwelling for jackals, a horror and a hissing, uninhabited. 
51:38 They roar together like young lions, growl like lions cubs. 
51:39 . 
51:40 “I will drag them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats. 
51:41 How has Sheshach been taken, the praise of the whole earth seized? How has Babylon become a horror among the nations! 
51:42 The sea has risen over Babylon— she is covered with its roaring waves. 
51:43 Her cities became desolation, a dry land, desert, uninhabited land, through which no son of man passes. 
51:44 I will punish Bel in Babylon— What he swallowed I will make him disgorge out of his mouth. Nations will no longer stream to him. Yes, the wall of Babylon has fallen! 
51:45 . 
51:46 Do not be faint-hearted, or be intimidated by the rumor heard in the land— one year one rumor comes, next year, another rumor. Yet violence will be in the land, with ruler against ruler. 
51:47 Therefore behold, days are coming when I will punish Babylon’s idols. Her entire land will be disgraced and all her slain will fall in her midst. 
51:48 . 
51:49 Yes, Babylon is to fall for the slain of Israel, even as the slain of all the earth fell to Babylon. 
51:50  to Jerusalem in your heart. 
51:51 ’s House.” 
51:52 — “when I will punish her idols, and the wounded will groan throughout all her land. 
51:53 . 
51:54 The sound of an outcry from Babylon! Great ruin from the land of Chaldea! 
51:55  is devastating Babylon, and will silence her loud voice. Their waves will roar like many waters. The noise of their voices will resound. 
51:56  is a God of restitution, He will fully repay. 
51:57 . 
51:58 : “Babylon’s thick wall will be totally razed and her high gates burned with fire. So the peoples are toiling for nothing, and nations weary themselves for fire.” 
51:59 The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, when he went with King Zedekiah of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was quartermaster. 
51:60 And Jeremiah wrote in a single scroll all the evil that would come upon Babylon, including all these words that were written about Babylon. 
51:61 Then Jeremiah said to Seraiah: “When you arrive in Babylon, then see that you read all these words, 
51:62 , you have spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that nothing will dwell there, neither man nor beast, but that it will be desolate forever.’ 
51:63 “Now when you have finished reading this scroll, you will tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates. 
51:64 Then you will say: ‘Thus will Babylon sink, and not rise again, because of the calamity that I will bring on her. So they will weary themselves.’” Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
52:1 Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king and he reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
52:2 ’s eyes, just like all Jehoiakim had done. 
52:3 ’s anger it came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that He had them cast out of His presence. So Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 
52:4 It came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came—he and all his army—against Jerusalem, and besieged it. They built a siege wall all around it. 
52:5 So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. 
52:6 In the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the famine was so severe in the city, that there was no food for the people of the land. 
52:7 Then the city was broken into, and all the men of war fled, going out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was near the king’s garden—even though the Chaldeans were all around the city. They were heading along the way of the Arabah. 
52:8 But the Chaldean army pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the desert plains of Jericho. Then all his army was scattered from him. 
52:9 Then they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath. He passed judgment on him. 
52:10 At Riblah, the king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah’s sons before his eyes, and also all the Judean leaders. 
52:11 Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes. Then the king of Babylon bound him in bronze chains, and brought him to Babylon, where he put him in prison until the day of his death. 
52:12 Now in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month—which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon—Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard came into Jerusalem to represent the king of Babylon. 
52:13 , the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem. He burned every large house with fire. 
52:14 Then all the Chaldean army, which was with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around. 
52:15 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile some of the poorest of the people, the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon, and what remained of the craftsmen. 
52:16 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen. 
52:17 , and carried all the bronze to Babylon. 
52:18 The pots, the shovels, the wick trimmers, the basins, the pans, and all the bronze articles for Temple service, they also took away. 
52:19 , the pans, and the drink offering bowls—whatever was gold or silver—the captain of the guard took away. 
52:20 —all these articles had bronze beyond weighing. 
52:21 The height of one pillar was 18 cubits and it was twelve cubits in circumference and four fingers in its thickness—it was hollow. 
52:22 There was a bronze capital on it—the height of one capital was five cubits, with latticework and pomegranates upon the capital all around, all of bronze. The second pillar was the same, with pomegranates. 
52:23 There were 96 pomegranates on the outside; including all the pomegranates around the lattice, there were 100. 
52:24 , and the three doorkeepers. 
52:25 From the city he took an officer who had been appointed over the men of war as well as seven men who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city, the scribe of the commander of the army, who enlisted people of the land, and 60 men of the people of the land who were found within the city. 
52:26 Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. 
52:27 The king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Then Judah was led away into exile from its land. 
52:28 These are the people whom Nebucha­dnez­zar carried away captive: in the seventh year 3,023 Jews; 
52:29 in Nebuchadnez­zar’s eighteenth year, 832 people from Jerusalem; 
52:30 in the Nebuchadnezzar’s twenty-third year, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard exiled 745 of the Jews—all together 4,600 people.
52:31 Now it came to pass on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Judah’s King Jehoiachin, that King Evil-merodach of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Judah’s King Jehoiachin, and released him out of prison. 
52:32 He spoke kindly to him and gave him a throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon. 
52:33 Then he changed out of his prison garments, dined regularly before him all the days of his life. 
52:34 As for his allowance, a regular allowance was given to him by the king of Babylon, a portion for each day until the day of his death, all the days of his life.
