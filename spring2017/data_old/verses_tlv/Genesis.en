1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 
1:2 Now the earth was chaos and waste, darkness was on the surface of the deep, and the Ruach Elohim was hovering upon the surface of the water. 
1:3 Then God said, “Let there be light!” and there was light. 
1:4 God saw that the light was good. So God distinguished the light from the darkness. 
1:5 God called the light “day,” and the darkness He called “night.” So there was evening and there was morning—one day. 
1:6 Then God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water! Let it be for separating water from water.” 
1:7 So God made the expanse and it separated the water that was below the expanse from the water that was over the expanse. And it happened so. 
1:8 God called the expanse “sky.” So there was evening and there was morning—a second day. 
1:9 Then God said, “Let the water below the sky be gathered to one place. Let the dry ground appear.” And it happened so. 
1:10 God called the dry ground “land,” and the collection of the water He called “seas.” And God saw that it was good. 
1:11 Then God said, “Let the land sprout grass, green plants yielding seed, fruit trees making fruit, each according to its species with seed in it, upon the land.” And it happened so. 
1:12 The land brought forth grass, green plants yielding seed, each according to its species, and trees making fruit with the seed in it, each according to its species. And God saw that it was good. 
1:13 So there was evening and there was morning—a third day. 
1:14 Then God said, “Let lights in the expanse of the sky be for separating the day from the night. They will be for signs and for seasons and for days and years. 
1:15 They will be for lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the land.” And it happened so. 
1:16 Then God made the two great lights—the greater light for dominion over the day, and the lesser light as well as the stars for dominion over the night. 
1:17 God set them in the expanse of the sky to shine on the land 
1:18 and to have dominion over the day and over the night and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. 
1:19 So there was evening and there was morning—a fourth day. 
1:20 Then God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures! Let flying creatures fly above the land across the expanse of the sky.” 
1:21 Then God created the large sea creatures and every living creature that crawls, with which the water swarms, according to their species, as well as every winged flying creature, according to their species. And God saw that it was good. 
1:22 Then God blessed them by saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the water in the seas. Let the flying creatures multiply on the land.” 
1:23 So there was evening and there was morning—a fifth day. 
1:24 Then God said, “Let the land bring forth living creatures according to their species—livestock, crawling creatures and wild animals, according to their species.” And it happened so. 
1:25 God made the wild animals according to their species, the livestock according to their species, and everything that crawls on the ground, each according to its species. And God saw that it was good. 
1:26 Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness! Let them rule over the fish of the sea, over the flying creatures of the sky, over the livestock, over the whole earth, and over every crawling creature that crawls on the land.” 
1:27 God created humankind in His image, in the image of God He created him, male and female He created them. 
1:28 God blessed them and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, fill the land, and conquer it. Rule over the fish of the sea, the flying creatures of the sky, and over every animal that crawls on the land.” 
1:29 Then God said, “I have just given you every green plant yielding seed that is on the surface of the whole land, and every tree, which has the fruit of a tree yielding seed. They are to be food for you. 
1:30 Also for every wild animal, every flying creature of the sky and every creature that crawls on the land which has life, every green plant is to be food.” And it happened so. 
1:31 So God saw everything that He made, and behold it was very good. So there was evening and there was morning—the sixth day.
2:1 So the heavens and the earth were completed along with their entire array. 
2:2 God completed—on the seventh day—His work that He made, and He ceased—on the seventh day—from all His work that He made. 
2:3 Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, for on it He ceased from all His work that God created for the purpose of preparing.
2:4  made land and sky. 
2:5  had not caused it to rain upon the land, and there was no one to work the ground. 
2:6 But a mist came up from the land and watered the whole surface of the ground. 
2:7  formed the man out of the dust from the ground and He breathed into his nostrils a breath of life—so the man became a living being. 
2:8  planted a garden in Eden in the east, and there He put the man whom He had formed. 
2:9  caused to sprout from the ground every tree that was desirable to look at and good for food. Now the Tree of Life was in the middle of the garden, and also the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. 
2:10 A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden. From there it divided and became four riverheads. 
2:11 The name of the first is Pishon, the one that winds around the whole land of the Havilah, where there is gold. 
2:12 The gold of that land is good—bdellium and lapis lazuli stones are also there. 
2:13 The name of the second river is Gihon—it winds around the whole land of Cush. 
2:14 The name of the third river is Tigris—it runs east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. 
2:15  took the man and gave him rest in the Garden of Eden in order to cultivate and watch over it.
2:16  commanded the man saying, “From all the trees of the garden you are most welcome to eat. 
2:17 But of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil you must not eat. For when you eat from it, you most assuredly will die! 
2:18  said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. Let Me make a well-matched helper for him.” 
2:19  had formed from the ground every animal of the field and every flying creature of the sky, so He brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called them—each living creature—that was its name. 
2:20 So the man gave names to all of the livestock, and to the flying creatures of the sky, and to all the animals of the field; but for the man He did not find a well-matched helper for him. 
2:21  caused a deep sleep to fall on the man and he slept; and He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place. 
2:22  built the rib, which He had taken from the man, into a woman. Then He brought her to the man. 
2:23 Then the man said, “This one, at last, is bone of my bones and flesh from my flesh. This one is called woman, for from man was taken this one.” 
2:24 This is why a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife; and they become one flesh. 
2:25 Now both of them were naked, the man and his wife, and they were not ashamed.
3:1  made. So it said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from all the trees of the garden’?” 
3:2 The woman said to the serpent, “Of the fruit of the trees, we may eat. 
3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God said, ‘You must not eat of it and you must not touch it, or you will die.’” 
3:4 The serpent said to the woman, “You most assuredly won’t die! 
3:5 For God knows that when you eat of it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” 
3:6 Now the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a thing of lust for the eyes, and that the tree was desirable for imparting wisdom. So she took of its fruit and she ate. She also gave to her husband who was with her and he ate. 
3:7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made for themselves loin-coverings. 
3:8  in the midst of the Tree of the garden. 
3:9  called to the man and He said to him, “Where are you?” 
3:10 Then he said, “Your sound—I heard it in the garden and I was afraid. Because I am naked, I hid myself.” 
3:11 Then He said, “Who told you that you are naked? Have you eaten from the Tree from which I commanded you not to eat?” 
3:12 Then the man said, “The woman whom You gave to be with me—she gave me of the Tree, and I ate.” 
3:13  said to the woman, “What did you do?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me and I ate.” 
3:14  said to the serpent, “Because you did this, Cursed are you above all the livestock and above every animal of the field. On your belly will you go, and dust will you eat all the days of your life. 
3:15 I will put animosity between you and the woman— between your seed and her seed. He will crush your head, and you will crush his heel. 
3:16 To the woman He said, “I will greatly increase your pain from conception to labor. In pain will you give birth to children. Your desire will be toward your husband, yet he must rule over you.” 
3:17 Then to the man He said, “Because you listened to your wife’s voice and ate of the tree which I commanded you, saying, ‘You must not eat of it’: Cursed is the ground because of you— with pain will you eat of it all the days of your life. 
3:18 Thorns and thistles will sprout for you. You will eat the plants of the field, 
3:19 By the sweat of your brow will you eat food, until you return to the ground, since from it were you taken. For you are dust, and to dust will you return.” 
3:20 Now Adam named his wife Eve because she was the mother of all the living. 
3:21  made Adam and his wife tunics of skin and He clothed them. 
3:22  said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil. So now, in case he stretches out his hand and takes also from the Tree of Life and eats and lives forever,” 
3:23  sent him away from the Garden of Eden, to work the ground from which he had been taken. 
3:24  dwell along, with the whirling sword of flame, to guard the way to the Tree of Life.
4:1 .” 
4:2 Then she gave birth again, to his brother Abel. Abel became a shepherd of flocks while Cain became a worker of the ground. 
4:3 , 
4:4  looked favorably upon Abel and his offering, 
4:5 but upon Cain and his offering He did not look favorably. Cain became very angry, and his countenance fell. 
4:6  said to Cain, “Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen? 
4:7 If you do well, it will lift. But if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the doorway. Its desire is for you, but you must master it.” 
4:8 Cain spoke to Abel his brother. While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him. 
4:9  said to Cain, “Where is Abel, your brother?” “I don’t know,” he said. “Am I my brother’s keeper?” 
4:10 Then He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to Me from the ground. 
4:11 So now, cursed are you from the ground which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. 
4:12 As often as you work the ground, it will not yield its crops to you again. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.” 
4:13 , “My iniquity is too great to bear! 
4:14 Since You expelled me today from the face of the ground and I must be hidden from Your presence, then I will be a restless wanderer on the earth—anyone who finds me will kill me!” 
4:15  put a mark on Cain, so that anyone who found him would not strike him down. 
4:16 ’s presence and dwelled in the Land of Wandering, east of Eden. 
4:17 Cain was intimate with his wife and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. And he was building a city, and he named the city after the name of his son, Enoch. 
4:18 And to Enoch was born Irad. Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech. 
4:19 Now Lamech took for himself two wives. The name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah. 
4:20 Adah gave birth to Jabal—he was the pioneer of tent dwellers with livestock. 
4:21 His brother’s name was Jubal—he was the pioneer of all who skillfully handle stringed instruments and wind instruments. 
4:22 Now Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-Cain, the forger of every kind of bronze and iron tools; Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah. 
4:23 Lamech said to his wives, “Adah and Zillah: Hear my voice! Lamech’s wives: Listen to my speech! For I have killed a man for wounding me, and a boy for bruising me. 
4:24 If Cain is to be avenged seven times, then Lamech—77 times!” 
4:25 Adam was intimate with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and she named him Seth, “For God has appointed me another seed in place of Abel—since Cain killed him.” 
4:26 ’s Name.
5:1 This is the Book of the Genealogies of Adam: When God created Adam, in the likeness of God He made him. 
5:2 Male and female He created them, and He blessed them and called their name “Adam” when He created them. 
5:3 Adam lived 130 years, then fathered a son in his likeness, after his image, and named him Seth. 
5:4 Then the days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years, and He fathered other sons and daughters. 
5:5 So all Adam’s days that he lived were 930 years, and then he died. 
5:6 Seth lived 105 years, then fathered Enosh. 
5:7 Seth lived 807 years after he fathered Enosh, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
5:8 So all Seth’s days were 912 years, and then he died. 
5:9 Enosh lived 90 years, then fathered Kenan. 
5:10 Enosh lived 815 years after he fathered Kenan, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
5:11 So all of Enosh’s days were 905 years, and then he died. 
5:12 Kenan lived 70 years, then fathered Mahalalel. 
5:13 Kenan lived 840 years after he fathered Mahalalel, he fathered sons and daughters. 
5:14 So all of Kenan’s days were 910 years, and then he died. 
5:15 Mahalalel lived 65 years, then fathered Jared. 
5:16 Mahalalel lived 830 years after he fathered Jared, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
5:17 So all of Mahalalel’s days were 895 years, and then he died. 
5:18 Jared lived 162 years, then fathered Enoch. 
5:19 Jared lived 800 years after he fathered Enoch, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
5:20 So all of Jared’s days were 962 years, and then he died. 
5:21 Enoch lived 65 years, then fathered Methuselah. 
5:22 Now Enoch walked with God continually for 300 years after he fathered Methuselah, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
5:23 So all of Enoch’s days were 365 years. 
5:24 And Enoch continually walked with God—then he was not there, because God took him. 
5:25 Methuselah lived 187 years and fathered Lamech. 
5:26 And Methuselah lived 782 years after he fathered Lamech, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
5:27 So all of Methuselah’s days were 969 years, and then he died. 
5:28 Lamech lived 182 years and he fathered a son. 
5:29  cursed.” 
5:30 Lamech lived 595 years after he fathered Noah, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
5:31 So all of Lamech’s days were 777 years, and then he died. 
5:32 And Noah was 500 years old when he fathered Shem, Ham and Japheth.
6:1 Now when humankind began to multiply on the face of the ground and daughters were born to them, 
6:2 then the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were good and they took for themselves wives, any they chose. 
6:3  said, “My Spirit will not remain with humankind forever, since they are flesh. So their days will be 120 years. 
6:4  were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, whenever the sons of God came to the daughters of men, and gave birth to them. Those were the mighty men of old, men of renown. 
6:5  saw that the wickedness of humankind was great on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their heart was only evil all the time. 
6:6  regretted that He made humankind on the earth, and His heart was deeply pained. 
6:7  said, “I will wipe out humankind, whom I have created, from the face of the ground, from humankind to livestock, crawling things and the flying creatures of the sky, because I regret that I made them.” 
6:8 ’s eyes.
6:9 These are the genealogies of Noah. Noah was a righteous man. He was blameless among his generation. Noah continually walked with God. 
6:10 Noah fathered three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth. 
6:11 Now the earth was ruined before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 
6:12 God saw the earth, and behold it was ruined because all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.
6:13 Then God said to Noah, “The end of all flesh is coming before Me, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. Behold, I am about to bring ruin upon them along with the land. 
6:14 Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood. You shall make the ark with compartments and smear pitch on it, both inside and out. 
6:15 Now this is how you shall make it: the length of the ark 300 cubits, its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits. 
6:16 You shall make a roof for the ark, and you shall finish it to within a cubit from the top. You shall put the door of the ark in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third stories. 
6:17 Now I am about to bring the flood—water upon the land—to destroy all flesh in which is the spirit of life from under the sky. Everything that is on the land will perish. 
6:18 But I will establish My covenant with you. So you shall come into the ark—you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you. 
6:19 Also of every living thing, of all flesh, you shall bring two of everything—male and female—into the ark to keep alive with you. 
6:20 Of the flying creatures according to their kind, of the livestock according to their kind, of all the crawling creatures of the ground according to their kind—two of everything will come to you to keep them alive. 
6:21 As for you: take for yourself every kind of edible food and gather it to yourself. It will be food for you and for them.” 
6:22 So Noah did according to all that God commanded him; he did so exactly.
7:1  said to Noah, “Come—you and all your household—into the ark. For you only do I perceive as righteous before Me in this generation. 
7:2 Of every clean animal you shall take with you seven of each kind, male and female; and of the animals which themselves are not clean two, male and female; 
7:3 also of the flying creatures of the sky seven of every kind, male and female, to keep offspring alive on the face of the whole land. 
7:4 For in seven more days, I am going to make it rain upon the land forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe out all existence that I made from the face of the ground. 
7:5  commanded him. 
7:6 Now Noah was 600 years old when the flood came—water upon the land. 
7:7 So Noah, his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, entered the ark because of the floodwaters. 
7:8 Of the clean animals and unclean animals, the flying creatures and everything that crawls on the ground, 
7:9 two by two they came to Noah, into the ark, male and female, just as God commanded Noah. 
7:10 After the seven days, the floodwaters were upon the land. 
7:11 In the six-hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on this day, all the water sources of the great deep burst open, and the windows of the sky were opened. 
7:12 Then there was rain upon the land 40 days and 40 nights. 
7:13 On that same day Noah, along with Noah’s sons Shem, Ham and Japheth, Noah’s wife and the three wives of Noah’s sons with them, entered the ark, 
7:14 they and every animal according to its kind, and all the livestock according to its kind, and every crawling creature that crawls on the land according to its kind, and every flying creature according to its kind, every bird, every winged creature. 
7:15 So to Noah and into the ark they went by twos—all flesh in which was the spirit of life. 
7:16  shut him in. 
7:17 The flood was forty days upon the land, and the waters increased and lifted the ark, so that it rose above the land. 
7:18 The waters overpowered and became very mighty over the land, and the ark drifted on the surface of the water. 
7:19 The waters completely overpowered the land so that all the high mountains beneath the entire sky were covered. 
7:20 The waters rose 15 cubits higher, as the mountains were covered. 
7:21 All flesh perished—those that crawl on the land, the flying creatures, livestock, wild animals, all creatures that swarm upon the land, and all humankind. 
7:22 Everything that had the breath of the spirit of life in its nostrils—everything on dry land—died. 
7:23 So He wiped out all existence that was upon the surface of the ground, everything from people to livestock, to crawling creatures, and to flying creatures of the sky. They were wiped out off the land. Only Noah and those with him in the ark survived. 
7:24 The waters overpowered the land for 150 days.
8:1 Then God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. So God caused a wind to pass over the land and the water subsided. 
8:2 Also the sources of the deep and the windows of the skies were closed up, and the rain from the sky was held back. 
8:3 The waters kept receding gradually from upon the land and the waters decreased by the end of 150 days. 
8:4 The ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 
8:5 The waters went on decreasing until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared. 
8:6 It was at the end of forty days that Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made. 
8:7 Then he sent out a raven and it kept going back and forth until the waters were drying up from the land. 
8:8 Then he sent out a dove to see whether the waters had receded from the surface of the ground. 
8:9 But the dove did not find a resting place for the sole of her foot. She returned to him in the ark because water covered the surface of the whole land. He stretched out his hand and he took her, and brought her to him into the ark. 
8:10 So he waited yet another seven days and again he sent the dove out from the ark. 
8:11 The dove came to him at evening, and surprisingly—a freshly plucked olive leaf was in its mouth. So Noah knew that the waters had receded from the land. 
8:12 After he waited seven more days, he sent out the dove, but she did not return to him again. 
8:13 It was in his six-hundred-and first year—in the first month, on the first day of the month—that the waters had dried up from the land. Then Noah removed the cover of the ark and he looked, and behold, the surface of the ground had dried up. 
8:14 By the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the land was dry. 
8:15 Then God spoke to Noah, saying, 
8:16 “Come out of the ark, you and your wife, your sons and your sons’ wives with you. 
8:17 Every animal that is with you of all flesh, including the flying creatures, livestock and every crawling creature that crawls on the land, bring out with you, and let them swarm in the land and be fruitful and multiply upon the land.” 
8:18 So Noah came out, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives. 
8:19 Every animal—every crawling creature, every flying creature, everything that crawls upon the land—came out from the ark in their families. 
8:20  and he took of every clean domestic animal and of every clean flying creature and he offered burnt offerings on the altar. 
8:21  said in His heart, “I will never again curse the ground on account of man, even though the inclination of the heart of humankind is evil from youth. Nor will I ever again smite all living creatures, as I have done. 
8:22 While all the days of the land remain, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will not cease.”
9:1 God blessed Noah and his sons, and He said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the land. 
9:2 The fear and terror of you will be on every wild animal, and on every flying creature of the sky, with everything that crawls on the ground and with all the fish of the sea—into your hand they are given. 
9:3 Every crawling thing that is alive will be food for you, as are the green plants—I have now given you everything. 
9:4 Only flesh with its life—that is, its blood—you must not eat! 
9:5 Surely your lifeblood will I avenge. From every animal and from every person will I avenge it. From every person’s brother will I avenge that person’s life. 
9:6 The one who sheds human blood, by a human will his blood be shed, for in God’s image He made humanity. 
9:7 But as for you, be fruitful and multiply! Flourish in the land and multiply in it.” 
9:8 Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, 
9:9 “Now I, behold, I am about to establish My covenant with you, and with your seed after you, 
9:10 and with every living creature that is with you, including the flying creatures, the livestock, and every wild animal with you, of all that is coming out of the ark—every animal of the earth. 
9:11 I will confirm My covenant with you—never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again will there be a flood to ruin the land.” 
9:12 Then God said, “This is the sign of the covenant that I am making between Me and you, and every living creature that is with you for all future generations. 
9:13 My rainbow do I place in the cloud, and it will be a sign of the covenant between Me and the land. 
9:14 Whenever I bring clouds over the land and the rainbow appears in the clouds, 
9:15 I will remember My covenant that is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
9:16 When the rainbow is in the cloud, I will look at it, to remember the perpetual covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the land.” 
9:17 Then God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant that I have confirmed between Me and all flesh that is on the land.”
9:18 Noah’s sons who came out from the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth, and Ham was the father of Canaan. 
9:19 These three were Noah’s sons, and from these the whole earth dispersed. 
9:20 Then Noah, a man of the soil, was first to plant a vineyard. 
9:21 He drank some of the wine, got drunk, and was uncovered in his tent. 
9:22 Then Ham, Canaan’s father, saw his father’s private parts and told his two brothers outside. 
9:23 So Shem and Japheth took the cloak and laid it over both their shoulders and walked backwards and with it covered their father’s private parts. But their faces were turned away, so they did not see their father’s private parts. 
9:24 When Noah woke up from his wine, he learned what his youngest son had done to him. 
9:25 So he said, “Cursed is Canaan: the lowest slave will he be to his brothers.” 
9:26 , God of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant. 
9:27 May God enlarge Japheth, may he dwell in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be his slave.” 
9:28 Now Noah lived 350 years after the flood. 
9:29 So all Noah’s days were 950 years. Then he died.
10:1 And these are the genealogical records of Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood. 
10:2 Japheth’s sons were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech and Tiras. 
10:3 Gomer’s sons were Ashkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah. 
10:4 Javan’s sons were Elishah and Tarshish, Kittites and Dodanites. 
10:5 From these the coastlands of the nations spread out in their lands, each one according to his language, according to their families, into their nations. 
10:6 Ham’s sons were Cush, Mizraim, Put and Canaan. 
10:7 Cush’s sons were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. And Raamah’s sons were Sheba, and Dedan. 
10:8 Now Cush fathered Nimrod. He started to become mighty in the land. 
10:9 .” 
10:10 The beginning of his kingdom included Babel, Erech, Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
10:11 From that land he went out to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rechovot-ir, Calah 
10:12 and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah—it is the great city. 
10:13 Mizraim fathered the Ludites, the Anamites, the Lehabites, the Naphtuhites, 
10:14 the Pathrusites, the Casluhites—from whom came the Philistines—and the Caphtorites. 
10:15 Canaan fathered Sidon his firstborn, Heth, 
10:16 the Jebusite, the Amorite, the Girgashite, 
10:17 the Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite, 
10:18 the Arvadite, the Zemarite and the Hamathite—and afterwards, the Canaanite families were scattered. 
10:19 Now the Canaanite border was from Zidon, as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; as you go toward Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 
10:20 These are Ham’s sons according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands, in their nations. 
10:21 Sons were also born to Shem, who was Japheth’s older brother and the father of all the sons of Eber. 
10:22 Shem’s sons were Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud and Aram. 
10:23 Aram’s sons were Uz, Hul, Gether and Mash. 
10:24 Arpachshad fathered Shelah, and Shelah fathered Eber. 
10:25 Two sons were born to Eber. The name of the first was Peleg—because in his days the land was divided—and his brother’s name was Joktan. 
10:26 Joktan fathered Elmodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
10:27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
10:28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
10:29 Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All of these are Joktan’s sons. 
10:30 Their dwelling place was from Mesha till you come toward Sephar, the eastern hill country. 
10:31 These are Shem’s sons, according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands, according to their nations. 
10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah according to their genealogies in their nations, and from these the nations were dispersed on the earth after the flood.
11:1 Now the entire earth had the same language with the same vocabulary. 
11:2 When they traveled eastward, they found a valley-plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. 
11:3 They said to one another, “Come! Let’s make bricks and bake them until they’re hard.” So they used bricks for stone, and tar for mortar. 
11:4 Then they said, “Come! Let’s build ourselves a city, with a tower whose top reaches into heaven. So let’s make a name for ourselves, or else we will be scattered over the face of the whole land.” 
11:5  came down to see the city and the tower that the sons of man had built. 
11:6  said, “Look, the people are one and all of them have the same language. So this is what they have begun to do. Now, nothing they plan to do will be impossible. 
11:7 Come! Let Us go down and confuse their language there, so that they will not understand each other’s language.” 
11:8  scattered them from there over the face of the entire land, and they stopped building the city. 
11:9  scattered them over the face of the entire world.
11:10 These are the genealogical records of Shem: Shem was 100 years old when he fathered Arpachshad—two years after the flood. 
11:11 Shem lived 500 years after he fathered Arpachshad, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
11:12 Arpachshad lived 35 years when he fathered Shelah. 
11:13 Arpachshad lived 403 years after he fathered Shelah, and fathered sons and daughters. 
11:14 Shelah lived 30 years and he fathered Eber. 
11:15 Shelah lived 403 years after he fathered Eber, and fathered sons and daughters. 
11:16 Eber lived 34 years and he fathered Peleg. 
11:17 Eber lived 430 years after he fathered Peleg, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
11:18 Peleg lived 30 years and he fathered Reu. 
11:19 Peleg lived 209 years after he fathered Reu, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
11:20 Reu lived 32 years and he fathered Serug. 
11:21 Reu lived 207 years after he fathered Serug, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
11:22 Serug lived 30 years and fathered Nahor. 
11:23 Serug lived 200 years after he fathered Nahor, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
11:24 Nahor lived 27 years and he fathered Terah. 
11:25 Nahor lived 119 years after he fathered Terah, and he fathered sons and daughters. 
11:26 Terah lived 70 years when he fathered Abram, Nahor and Haran. 
11:27 These are Terah’s genealogies: Terah fathered Abram, Nahor and Haran. Haran fathered Lot. 
11:28 Haran died before Terah his father, in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 
11:29 Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah—the daughter of Haran, father of Milcah and Iscah. 
11:30 Sarai was barren; she did not have a child. 
11:31 Terah took Abram his son and Lot, Haran’s son, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife, and he took them out of Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan. But when they came to Haran, they settled there. 
11:32 Terah’s days were 205 years, and Terah died in Haran.
12:1  said to Abram, “Get going out from your land, and from your relatives, and from your father’s house, to the land that I will show you. 
12:2 My heart’s desire is to make you into a great nation, to bless you, to make your name great so that you may be a blessing. 
12:3 My desire is to bless those who bless you, but whoever curses you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth will be blessed. 
12:4  had spoken to him. Also Lot went with him. (Now Abram was 75 years old when he departed from Haran.) 
12:5 Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his nephew, and all their possessions that they had acquired, and the people that they acquired in Haran, and they left to go to the land of Canaan, and they entered the land of Canaan. 
12:6 Abram passed through the land as far as the place of Shechem, as far as Moreh’s big tree. (The Canaanites were in the land then.) 
12:7 , who had appeared to him. 
12:8 . 
12:9 So Abram kept on journeying southward. 
12:10 Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to live as an outsider there, because the famine was severe in the land. 
12:11 Just as he was about to enter Egypt he said to Sarai his wife, “Look, please, I know that you are an attractive woman. 
12:12 So when the Egyptians see you they’ll say, ‘This is his wife.’ And they’ll kill me; but you, they’ll let live. 
12:13 Please say that you are my sister, so that I’ll be treated well for your sake, and my life will be spared because of you.” 
12:14 When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians did see that the woman was very beautiful. 
12:15 Indeed, Pharaoh’s officials saw her and they raved about her to Pharaoh. Then the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house. 
12:16 But Abram was treated well for her sake, and he got sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male and female slaves, female donkeys and camels. 
12:17  struck Pharaoh and his household with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife. 
12:18 So Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What’s this that you did to me? Why didn’t you tell me that she is your wife? 
12:19 Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now, here is your wife. Take—and go!” 
12:20 Then Pharaoh instructed men concerning him, and they expelled him, with his wife, and everything that belonged to him.
13:1 So Abram went up from Egypt—he and his wife and everything that belonged to him, and Lot with him—to the Negev. 
13:2 Now Abram was very rich in livestock, silver and gold. 
13:3 He proceeded by stages from the Negev as far as Beth-El—to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-El and Ai, 
13:4 . 
13:5 Now Lot, who was going with Abram, also had sheep and cattle and tents, 
13:6 so that the land could not support them living together, because their possessions were many, and they were not able to stay together. 
13:7 So there was a quarrel between the shepherds of Abram’s livestock and the shepherds of Lot’s livestock. (Now the Canaanites and the Perizzites were living in the land then.) 
13:8 So Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no strife between me and you, or between my shepherds and yours, since we are relatives. 
13:9 Isn’t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If to the left, then I’ll go to the right, and if to the right, then I’ll go to the left.” 
13:10 ’s garden, like the land of Egypt—till you come to Zoar. 
13:11 So Lot chose for himself the whole area surrounding the Jordan. Lot journeyed to the east, and they separated from each other. 
13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the valley. And he moved his tent from place to place near Sodom. 
13:13 . 
13:14  had said to Abram, “lift up your eyes, now, and look from the place where you are, to the north, south, east and west. 
13:15 For all the land that you are looking at, I will give to you and to your seed forever. 
13:16 I will make your seed like the dust of the earth so that if one could count the dust of the earth, then your seed could also be counted. 
13:17 Get up! Walk about the land through its length and width—for I will give it to you.” 
13:18 .
14:1 Now it came about in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, 
14:2 that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (this is Zoar). 
14:3 All of these kings joined forces in the Valley of the Siddim (this is the Salt Sea). 
14:4 For 12 years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 
14:5 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came with the kings who were with him, and they defeated the Rephaim in Ashterot-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiryataim, 
14:6 and the Horites in the hill country of Seir as far as El-Paran, which is beside the wilderness. 
14:7 Then they came again to En-mishpat (this is Kadesh), and they subdued all the territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who live in Hazazon-tamar. 
14:8 Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (this is Zoar) went out and lined themselves up for battle with them in the Valley of the Siddim, 
14:9 against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar: four kings against five. 
14:10 Now the Valley of the Siddim was full of tar pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell into them, and those who remained fled to the hills. 
14:11 So they took all of Sodom and Gomorrah’s possessions and their food and left. 
14:12 They also took Lot, Abram’s nephew, and his possessions, and they left (as he was living in Sodom). 
14:13 Then a survivor came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was dwelling by the large trees belonging to Mamre the Amorite, the brother of Eschol and the brother of Aner—they were Abram’s allies. 
14:14 When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he rallied his trained men, those born in his household, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan. 
14:15 Then he divided his servants against them at night, and he defeated them and pursued them as far as Hovah, which is north of Damascus. 
14:16 He brought back all the possessions, and also brought back his kinsman Lot and his possessions, as well as the women and the other people. 
14:17 Now after he returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (this is the King’s Valley). 
14:18 . 
14:19 , Creator of heaven and earth, 
14:20 , Who gave over your enemies Into your hand.” Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything. 
14:21 Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people—the possessions take for yourself.” 
14:22 , Creator of heaven and earth. 
14:23 Not a thread or even a sandal strap of all that is yours will I take, so you will not say, ‘I’ve made Abram rich!’ 
14:24 I claim nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me—Aner, Eschol, and Mamre—let them take their share.”
15:1  came to Abram in a vision saying, “Do not fear, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward.” 
15:2 , what will You give me, since I am living without children, and the heir of my household is Eliezer of Damascus?” 
15:3 Then Abram said, “Look! You have given me no seed, so a house-born servant is my heir.” 
15:4  came to him saying, “This one will not be your heir, but in fact, one who will come from your own body will be your heir. 
15:5 He took him outside and said, “Look up now, at the sky, and count the stars—if you are able to count them.” Then He said to him, “So shall your seed be.” 
15:6  and He reckoned it to him as righteousness. 
15:7  who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans, in order to give you this land to inherit it.” 
15:8 , how will I know that I will inherit it?” 
15:9 Then He said to him, “Bring Me a three year old young cow, a three year old she-goat, a three year old ram, a turtle-dove and a young bird.” 
15:10 So he brought all these to Him and cut them in half, and put each piece opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds. 
15:11 Then birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. 
15:12 When the sun was about to set and a deep sleep fell on Abram, behold, terror of great darkness was falling upon him! 
15:13 Then He said to Abram, “Know for certain that your seed will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, and they will be enslaved and oppressed 400 years. 
15:14 But I am going to judge the nation that they will serve. Afterward they will go out with many possessions. 
15:15 But you, you will come to your fathers in peace. You will be buried at a good old age. 
15:16 Then in the fourth generation they will return here—for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.” 
15:17 When the sun set and it became dark, behold, there was a smoking oven and a fiery torch that passed between these pieces. 
15:18  cut a covenant with Abram, saying, “I give this land to your seed, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates River: 
15:19 the Kenite, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 
15:20 the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Raphaites, 
15:21 the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”
16:1 Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had not borne him children. But she had an Egyptian slave-girl—her name was Hagar. 
16:2  has prevented me from having children. Go, please, to my slave-girl. Perhaps I’ll get a son by her.” Abram listened to Sarai’s voice. 
16:3 So Sarai, Abram’s wife, took her slave-girl Hagar the Egyptian—after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan—and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife. 
16:4 Then he went to Hagar and she became pregnant. When she saw that she was pregnant, in her eyes her mistress was belittled. 
16:5  judge between you and me!” 
16:6 Abram said to Sarai, “Look! Your slave-girl is in your hand. Do to her what is good in your eyes.” So Sarai afflicted her, and she fled from her presence. 
16:7  found her by the spring of water in the wilderness, next to the spring on the way to Shur. 
16:8 He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s slave-girl, where have you come from and where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.” 
16:9  said, “Return to your mistress and humble yourself under her hand.” 
16:10  said to her, “I will bountifully multiply your seed, and they will be too many to count.” 
16:11  has heard your affliction. 
16:12 He will be a wild donkey of a man. His hand will be against everyone, and everyone’s hand against him, and away from all his brothers will he dwell. 
16:13  who was speaking to her, “You are the God who sees me.” For she said, “Would I have gone here indeed looking for Him who looks after me?” 
16:14 That is why the well is named, the Well of the Living One Who Sees Me. (Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.) 
16:15 Then Hagar gave birth to a son for Abram, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. 
16:16 Abram was 86 years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael for Abram.
17:1 . Continually walk before Me and you will be blameless. 
17:2 My heart’s desire is to make My covenant between Me and you, and then I will multiply you exceedingly much.” 
17:3 Abram fell on his face, and God spoke with him, saying, 
17:4 “For My part, because My covenant is with you, you will be the father of a multitude of nations. 
17:5 No longer will your name be Abram, but your name will be Abraham, because I make you the father of a multitude of nations. 
17:6 Yes, I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make you into nations, and kings will come forth from you. 
17:7 Yes, I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, in order to be your God and your seed’s God after you. 
17:8 I will give to you and to your seed after you the land where you are an outsider —the whole land of Canaan—as an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.” 
17:9 God also said to Abraham, “As for you, My covenant you must keep, you and your seed after you throughout their generations. 
17:10 This is My covenant that you must keep between Me and you and your seed after you: all your males must be circumcised. 
17:11 You must be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and this will become a sign of the covenant between Me and you. 
17:12 Also your eight-day-olds must be circumcised, every male, throughout your generations, including a house-born slave or a slave bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your seed. 
17:13 Your house-born slave and your purchased slave must surely be circumcised. So My covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 
17:14 But the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin—that person will be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.” 
17:15 God also said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her by the name Sarai. Rather, Sarah is her name. 
17:16 And I will bless her, and moreover, I will give you a son from her. I will bless her and she will give rise to nations. Kings of the peoples will come from her.” 
17:17 Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said to his heart, “Will a son be born to a 100-year-old man? Or will Sarah—who is 90 years old—give birth?” 
17:18 So Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael might live before you!” 
17:19 But God said, “On the contrary, Sarah your wife will bear you a son and you must name him Isaac. So I will confirm My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his seed after him. 
17:20 As for Ishmael, I have heard you. See, I have blessed him and I will make him fruitful, and I will multiply him very very much. He will father twelve princes and I will make him a great nation. 
17:21 But My covenant will I establish with Isaac whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year.” 
17:22 When He finished speaking with him, God went up from Abraham. 
17:23 Then Abraham took Ishmael his son and all of his house-born slaves and all his purchased slaves—every male among the men of Abraham’s house—and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on this very same day, just as God had spoken with him. 
17:24 Abraham was 99 years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, 
17:25 and his son Ishmael was 13 years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
17:26 On this very same day Abraham and Ishmael his son were circumcised. 
17:27 Also all the men of his house, house-born slaves and slaves purchased from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
18:1  appeared to him at Mamre’s large trees while he was sitting in the entrance of his tent during the heat of the day. 
18:2 When he lifted up his eyes to see, suddenly, three men were standing right by him. When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed down to the ground. 
18:3 Then he said, “My Lord, if now I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass by your servant. 
18:4 Please let a little water be brought so you can wash your feet, and make yourselves comfortable under the tree. 
18:5 And let me bring a bit of bread so that you can refresh yourselves—then you can pass on—since you have passed by your servant. They said, “Do just as you have said.” 
18:6 So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quick! Knead three measures of fine flour and prepare bread loaves!” 
18:7 Then to the herd Abraham ran and took a young ox, tender and good, and he gave it to the servant, who prepared it quickly. 
18:8 Then he took butter and milk and the young ox that he had prepared and set it before them. While he was standing by them under the tree, they ate. 
18:9 Then they said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” “There, in the tent,” he said. 
18:10 Then He said, “I will most surely return to you in about a year’s time, surprisingly, Sarah your wife will have a son.” Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which was behind Him. 
18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years—Sarah had stopped having the way of women. 
18:12 So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, “After I’ve grown decrepit, can I have desire—and my lord so old?” 
18:13  said to Abraham, “Why is it that Sarah laughed, saying, ‘Can I really give birth when I am so old?’ 
18:14 ? At the appointed time I will return to you—in about a year—and Sarah will have a son.” 
18:15 Sarah denied it saying, “I didn’t laugh!” For she was afraid. But He said, “No—for you did laugh.”
18:16 Then the men got up from there and looked down over Sodom. Abraham was walking with them to send them off, 
18:17  said, “Should I keep secret from Abraham what I am about to do, 
18:18 seeing that Abraham will most certainly become a great and mighty nation and in him all the nations of the earth will be blessed? 
18:19  may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken about him.” 
18:20  said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great indeed, and their sin is very grievous indeed. 
18:21 I want to go down now, and see if they deserve destruction, as its outcry has come to Me. And if not, I will know.” 
18:22 . 
18:23 Abraham drew near and said, “Will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked? 
18:24 Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you really sweep away and not spare the place for the sake of fifty righteous who are in it? 
18:25 Far be it from You to do such a thing—to cause the righteous to die with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked share the same fate! Far be it from You! Shall the Judge of the whole world not exercise justice?” 
18:26  said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous people within the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.” 
18:27 Then Abraham answered and said, “Look, pray, I have decided to speak to my Lord, though I am dust and ashes. 
18:28 Suppose the fifty righteous people are lacking five. Will You destroy the whole city for lack of five?” And He said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.” 
18:29 So he spoke to Him yet again and said, “Perhaps forty will be found there?” And He said, “I will not do it for the sake of the forty.” 
18:30 Then he said, “Please, let my Lord not be angry, so I may speak. Perhaps thirty will be found there?” And He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.” 
18:31 Then he said, “Look, pray, I have decided to speak to my Lord: Perhaps twenty will be found there?” And He said, “I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty.” 
18:32 Then he said, “Please, let not my Lord be angry, so I may speak once more. Perhaps ten will be found there?” And He said, “I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten.” 
18:33  left, and Abraham returned to his place.
19:1 Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, while Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he got up to meet them, and bowed down with his face to the ground. 
19:2 Then he said, “Here, please my lords, please turn aside to your servant’s house, spend the night and wash your feet. Then you can get up early and go on your way.” But they said, “No. We will spend the night in the open plaza.” 
19:3  , and they ate. 
19:4 They had not yet lain down when the men of the city (the men of Sodom) surrounded the house—from youth to elderly, all the people without exception. 
19:5 And they called out to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have relations with them!” 
19:6 But Lot went out to them at the doorway and shut the door behind him, 
19:7 and said, “Please, my brothers, don’t act wickedly. 
19:8 Look, I have two daughters who haven’t been intimate with a man. Please let me bring them out to you—do to them whatever is good in your eyes! However, do nothing to these men—since they have come under the protection of my roof.” 
19:9 “Get out of the way!” they said, and they said, “This one came as an outsider and dares to judge! Now we’ll treat you worse than them!” So they strongly pressed against the man, Lot, and moved in close to break the door down. 
19:10 But the men reached out their hands, brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. 
19:11 Then they struck the men at the doorway of the house with blindness—from youth to elderly—so that they gave up trying to find the doorway. 
19:12 Then the men said to Lot, “Who else related to you is still here? A son-in-law, your sons and your daughters, whoever else is related to you in the city—bring them out of the place! 
19:13  has sent us to destroy it.” 
19:14  is about to destroy the city!” But in the eyes of his sons-in-law, he was like a joker. 
19:15 So when morning dawned the angels rushed Lot, saying, “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or else you will be swept away with the city’s iniquity!” 
19:16 ’s compassion for him—and they brought him out and left him outside the city. 
19:17 When they brought them outside, one said, “Flee for your life! Do not look behind you, and do not stop anywhere in the surrounding area! Escape to the hills, or else you’ll be swept away!” 
19:18 But Lot said to them, “No, my Lord, please! 
19:19 Look, please, your servant has found favor in Your eyes and You have magnified Your merciful loyalty, which You have shown me by letting me live. But I can’t escape to the hill country—for the disaster will overtake me and I’ll die! 
19:20 Look, please, this city is close enough to flee there, and it’s little. Please let me escape there. Isn’t it small? And let me live!” 
19:21 So He said to him, “Behold, I will grant your request concerning this matter too—not to demolish the city of which you have spoken. 
19:22 Hurry! Flee to safety there, because I cannot do anything until you arrive there.” (This is why the town is named Zoar.) 
19:23 The moment the sun rose upon the land, Lot entered Zoar, 
19:24  out of the sky. 
19:25 So He demolished these cities and the whole surrounding area, all the inhabitants of the cities and the vegetation of the ground. 
19:26 But his wife looked behind him and she turned into a pillar of salt. 
19:27 , 
19:28 and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward the entire land of the surrounding area, and saw, behold, the smoke of the land ascended like smoke from a furnace. 
19:29 So it was, as God destroyed the cities of the surrounding area, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the upheaval, when He demolished the cities where Lot had dwelt. 
19:30 Then Lot went up from Zoar and dwelled on the mountain, his two daughters with him, because he was afraid to dwell in Zoar. So he lived in a cave—he and his two daughters. 
19:31 Then the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to come to us as is the custom of the whole land. 
19:32 Come on! Let’s make our father drink wine so that we can lie with him and keep the seed from our father alive. 
19:33 So they made their father drink wine that night, and the firstborn came and lay down with her father. Yet he did not know that she lay down and got up. 
19:34 On the following day, the firstborn said to the younger, “See! I slept with my father last night. Let’s make him drink wine tonight as well. Come on! Sleep with him so that we’ll keep the seed from our father alive.” 
19:35 So they made their father drink wine that night as well, and the younger got up and lay down with him and he did not know that she lay down and got up. 
19:36 So Lot’s two daughters become pregnant by their father. 
19:37 Then the firstborn gave birth to a son and named him Moab: he is the ancestor of the Moabites to this day. 
19:38 The younger also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-Ammi: he is the ancestor of the sons of Ammon to this day.
20:1 Then Abraham journeyed from there to the land of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was dwelling as an outsider in Gerar, 
20:2 Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” So King Abimelech of Gerar sent for and took Sarah. 
20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream at night and said to him, “Behold, you are as good as dead, because of the woman whom you have taken—since she is a married woman.” 
20:4 Now Abimelech had not come near her. So he said, “My Lord, will You slay a nation, even though innocent? 
20:5 Didn’t he say to me, ‘She’s my sister’? And she herself even said, ‘He’s my brother.’ I did this with integrity of my heart and guiltlessness of my hands.” 
20:6 Then God said to him in a dream, “Yes, I myself knew that you did this with integrity of your heart, so I, yes I Myself prevented you from sinning against Me. That is why I did not allow you to touch her. 
20:7 So now, return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet. And let him pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, know that you will surely die—you and all who are yours.” 
20:8 Abimelech rose early in the morning, called all his servants and spoke all these words in their ears—and the men were very frightened. 
20:9 Then Abimelech called to Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us, and how have I sinned against you, that you brought great sin upon me and my kingdom? You’ve done to me things that should not be done!” 
20:10 Abimelech also said to Abraham, “What motivated you to do this thing?” 
20:11 Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘There is certainly no fear of God in this place, so they’ll kill me, because of my wife.’ 
20:12 And besides, she really is my sister. She’s my father’s daughter, though not my mother’s daughter. Then she became my wife. 
20:13 So when God made me wander away from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is your loyalty that you must show me: in every place we go, say of me, ‘He is my brother.’” 
20:14 Then Abimelech took sheep, cattle, male slaves and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and returned his wife Sarah to him. 
20:15 Then Abimelech said, “Look, my land is before you. Dwell wherever it pleases you.” 
20:16 At the same time he said to Sarah, “Look, I’ve given a thousand shekels to your brother. Look, it is compensation for everything that happened—so to everyone with you, you are vindicated.” 
20:17 Then Abraham prayed to God and God healed Abimelech, his wife and his female slaves so that they could bear children. 
20:18  had completely locked up every womb in Abimelech’s household because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.
21:1  did for Sarah just as He had spoken. 
21:2 So Sarah became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time that God had told him. 
21:3 Abraham named his son who was born to him—whom Sarah bore for him—Isaac. 
21:4 Then Abraham circumcised Isaac, his eight-day-old son, just as God had commanded him. 
21:5 Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac his son was born to him. 
21:6 So Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me! Everyone who hears will laugh with me.” 
21:7 She also said, “Who would have said to Abraham, ‘Sarah has nursed children’? For I have given birth to a son in his old age!” 
21:8 The child grew and was weaned—Abraham made a big feast on the day Isaac was weaned. 
21:9 But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian whom she had born to Abraham—making fun. 
21:10 So she said to Abraham, “Drive out this female slave and her son, for the son of this female slave will not be an heir with my son—with Isaac.” 
21:11 Now the matter was very displeasing in Abraham’s eyes on account of his son. 
21:12 But God said to Abraham, “Do not be displeased about the boy and your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For through Isaac shall your seed be called. 
21:13 Yet I will also make the son of the slave woman into a nation, because he is your seed.” 
21:14 So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away. She went and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. 
21:15 When the water from the skin was finished, she abandoned the child under one of the bushes. 
21:16 Then she went and sat herself down opposite, about a bowshot away, for she had said, “I can’t bear to see the child dying!” So she sat down opposite and lifted up her voice and wept. 
21:17 Then God heard the boy’s voice and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, and He said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, because God has heard the boy’s voice where he is. 
21:18 Get up! Lift the boy up, and hold on to him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.” 
21:19 Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water, and she went and filled the water skin, and gave the boy a drink. 
21:20 God was with the boy and he grew. He dwelled in the wilderness and became an archer. 
21:21 He dwelled in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
21:22 Now it came about at that same time that Abimelech—with Phicol the commander of his army---said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do. 
21:23 So now, make a pledge to me here, by God, that you will not violate your word with me or with my descendants or with my offspring. As I have shown loyalty to you, show the same to me, and to the land in which you have lived as an outsider.” 
21:24 Abraham said, “I make a pledge.” 
21:25 Now Abraham had rebuked Abimelech because of the well of water that Abimelech’s servants had seized. 
21:26 So Abimelech said, “I don’t know who did this thing. Nor did you tell me, nor did I hear about it until today.” 
21:27 Then Abraham took a flock of sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant. 
21:28 Abraham set seven young ewe-lambs apart from the flock of sheep by themselves. 
21:29 Abimelech said to Abraham, “What do these seven ewe-lambs that you’ve set by themselves mean?” 
21:30 He said, “You are to accept the seven ewe-lambs from my hand, so that they may be a witness for me that I dug this well.” 
21:31 That is why that place is named Beer-sheba, because there both of them made a pledge, 
21:32 and they made a covenant in Beer-sheba. Then Abimelech got up, with Phicol the commander of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines. 
21:33 , the Everlasting God. 
21:34 He lived as an outsider in the land of the Philistines for many days.
22:1 ,” he said. 
22:2 Then He said, “Take your son, your only son whom you love —Isaac—and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains about which I will tell you.” 
22:3 So Abraham got up early in the morning, saddled his donkey and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. He split wood for the burnt offering, and got up and went to the place about which God had told him. 
22:4 On the third day, Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from a distance. 
22:5 Abraham said to his young men, “Sit yourselves down here with the donkey. As for me and the young man, we’ll go over there, worship and return to you.” 
22:6 Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and put it on Isaac his son. In his hand he took the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together. 
22:7 Then Isaac said to Abraham his father, “My father?” Then he said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “Look. Here’s the fire and the wood. But where’s the lamb for a burnt offering?” 
22:8 Abraham said, “God will provide for Himself a lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” The two of them walked on together. 
22:9 Then they came to the place about which God had told him, and Abraham built the altar there, laid out the wood, bound up Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 
22:10 Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. 
22:11 !” 
22:12 Then He said, “Do not reach out your hand against the young man—do nothing to him at all. For now I know that you are one who fears God—you did not withhold your son, your only son, from Me.” 
22:13 Then Abraham lifted up his eyes and behold, there was a ram, just caught in the thick bushes by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. 
22:14  will provide.” 
22:15  called to Abraham a second time from heaven 
22:16 —because you have done this thing, and you did not withhold your son, your only son, 
22:17 I will richly bless you and bountifully multiply your seed like the stars of heaven, and like the sand that is on the seashore, and your seed will possess the gate of his enemies. 
22:18 In your seed all the nations of the earth will be blessed—because you obeyed My voice.” 
22:19 Then Abraham returned to his young men and they got up and went together to Beer-sheba. Then Abraham dwelled in Beer- sheba. 
22:20 Now it was after these things that it was told to Abraham, “Look, Milcah has also borne sons to Nahor your brother: 
22:21 Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, 
22:22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Yidlaph and Bethuel.” 
22:23 Then Bethuel fathered Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother. 
22:24 His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash and Maacah.
23:1 Now Sarah’s life was 127 years—the years of Sarah’s life. 
23:2 Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her. 
23:3 Then Abraham rose from before his dead one and spoke to the sons of Heth saying, 
23:4 “I am an outsider and a sojourner among you. Give me a gravesite among you so that I may bury my dead from before my presence.” 
23:5 The sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, 
23:6 “Listen to us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our graves. None among us will withhold his grave from you, to bury your dead one.” 
23:7 Then Abraham got up and bowed down to the people of the land, to the sons of Heth, 
23:8 and spoke with them saying, “If you are of a mind to let me bury my dead from before my presence, listen to me. Plead with Ephron son of Zophar on my behalf, 
23:9 that he may give me the cave of Machpelah that belongs to him, that is at the end of his field. At the full price let him give it to me in your midst for a gravesite.” 
23:10 Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the sons of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the ears of the sons of Heth, all those who enter the gate of his city, saying, 
23:11 “No, my lord, listen to me. The field—I hereby give it to you. Also the cave that is in it—I hereby give it to you. In the eyes of the sons of my people, I hereby give it to you. Bury your dead one.” 
23:12 Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land, 
23:13 and spoke to Ephron in the ears of the people of the land saying, “But if only you would please listen to me. I hereby give the price of the field. Accept it from me that I may bury my dead one there.” 
23:14 So Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, 
23:15 “My lord, listen to me. A land worth 400 shekels of silver—what is that between me and you? Bury your dead one.” 
23:16 Abraham heard Ephron. So Abraham weighed out to Ephron the silver that he had spoken of in the ears of the sons of Heth—400 shekels of silver at the merchant’s rate. 
23:17 Now Ephron’s field that is in Machpelah next to Mamre—the field and the cave that is in it, and all the trees that are in the field in all its surrounding territory—was handed over 
23:18 to Abraham as a purchased possession in the eyes of the sons of Heth, before all those who enter the gate of his city. 
23:19 Afterward, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah next to Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan. 
23:20 So the field and the cave that was in it were handed over to Abraham as a gravesite from the sons of Heth.
24:1  blessed Abraham in everything. 
24:2 Then Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household who managed everything that belonged to him, “Now put your hand under my thigh, 
24:3 , the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from among the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am dwelling. 
24:4 On the contrary, to my land and to my relatives you must go and get a wife for my son Isaac. 
24:5 But the servant said to him, “Suppose the woman were unwilling to follow after me to this land? Should I then have your son go back to the land you came from? 
24:6 Abraham said to him, “See to it that you don’t return my son there. 
24:7 , the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from my native land and who spoke to me and made a pledge to me saying, ‘To your seed I will give this land’—He will send His angel before you and you will take a wife for my son from there. 
24:8 If the woman is not willing to follow after you, then you will be free from this oath of mine. Nevertheless, you must not return my son there.” 
24:9 So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and he made a pledge to him concerning this matter. 
24:10 Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and left with all the best of his master’s things in his hand. Then he arose and went to Aram-Naharaim, to Nahor’s city. 
24:11 Then he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time, the time for the going out to draw water. 
24:12 , the God of Abraham my master,” he said, “please make something happen before me today, and show loyalty to Abraham my master. 
24:13 Look, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are going out to draw water. 
24:14 Now let it be that the young woman to whom I say, ‘Please tip your jar so that I may drink,’ and she will say, ‘Drink—and I’ll also water your camels’—let her be the one You have appointed for your servant Isaac. So by this I’ll know that You have shown graciousness to my master.” 
24:15 Now before he had finished speaking, behold there was Rebekah (who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother) going out with her jar on her shoulder. 
24:16 Now the young woman was very good looking, a girl of marriageable age, and she was a virgin. She went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up. 
24:17 Then the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me sip a little water from your jar.” 
24:18 So she said, “Drink, my lord,” and she quickly lowered her jar onto her hand and gave him a drink. 
24:19 Now when she finished giving him a drink, she said, “I’ll also draw water for your camels until they’ve finished drinking.” 
24:20 So she quickly poured out her jug into the trough, ran back to the well to draw water, and drew water for all his camels, 
24:21  had made his way successful. 
24:22 Now after the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a nose ring of gold weighing a half-shekel and two bracelets on her hands weighing ten shekels of gold. 
24:23 “Whose daughter are you?” he said. “Please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?” 
24:24 She said to him, “I’m the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.” 
24:25 She also said to him, “There’s both straw and plenty of feed with us, as well as room to spend the night.” 
24:26 , 
24:27  has guided me in the way to the house of my master’s brothers.” 
24:28 Then the young woman ran and told her mother’s house these things. 
24:29 Now Rebekah had a brother and his name was Laban, and Laban ran outside to the man at the spring. 
24:30 As soon as he saw the nose ring and the bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister saying, “Thus the man said to me,” he went to the man. There he was, standing by the camels at the spring. 
24:31 . Why are you standing outside when I’ve tidied up the house and there is room for the camels?” 
24:32 So the man came to the house and he unloaded the camels. Straw and feed were given to the camels and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 
24:33 Food was placed before him to eat, but he said, “I won’t eat until I’ve stated my business.” So he said, “Speak.” 
24:34 “I am Abraham’s servant,” he said. 
24:35  has blessed my master very much so that he has become great, and He has given to him flocks of sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male slaves and female slaves, camels and donkeys. 
24:36 Now Sarah, my master’s wife, gave birth to a son for my master after she was old, and He gave him everything he owns. 
24:37 Then my master made me take an oath, saying, ‘You must not take a wife for my son from among the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I’m dwelling.’ 
24:38 Instead you must go to my father’s house and to my family, and take a wife for my son.’ 
24:39 But I said to my master, ‘Suppose the woman won’t come back with me?’ 
24:40 , before whom I’ve walked continually, will send His angel with you, and He will make your way successful, and you will take a wife for my son from my family and from my father’s household. 
24:41 Then you’ll be free from my oath—if you come to my family and if they don’t give her to you—then you’ll be free from my oath.’ 
24:42 , the God of Abraham my master, if You are really going to make my way upon which I am walking successful, 
24:43 look, I’m standing by the spring of water. So let it be that the unmarried girl who is going out to draw water, to whom I’ll say, “Please give me a little water to drink from your jug,” 
24:44  appoints for my master’s son!’ 
24:45 I had not yet finished speaking to my heart, and behold there was Rebekah going out—her jug was on her shoulder and she went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’ 
24:46 And she quickly lowered her jug off of her and said, ‘Drink, and I’ll also water your camels.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels. 
24:47 Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ Then I placed the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her hands. 
24:48 , the God of my master Abraham, who guided me on the true way to take the daughter of my master’s brother for his son. 
24:49 So now, if you’re really going to show loyalty and truth to my master, tell me. But if not, tell me and I’ll turn to the right or to the left.” 
24:50 . We cannot speak to you bad or good. 
24:51  has spoken.” 
24:52 . 
24:53 Then the servant brought out articles of silver and gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious gifts to her brothers and to her mother. 
24:54 Then they ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and spent the night. When they arose in the morning, he said, “Send me off to my master.” 
24:55 But her brother with her mother said, “Let the young woman stay with us a few days—or ten. Afterwards she may go.” 
24:56  has made my way successful. Send me off so that I can go to my master.” 
24:57 So they said, “We’ll call the young woman and let’s ask her opinion.” 
24:58 Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will go.” 
24:59 So they sent Rebekah their sister off with her nanny, and Abraham’s servant and his men, 
24:60 and they blessed Rebekah and said to her: “Our sister, may you become thousands of ten thousands, and may your seed possess the gate of those who hate him.” 
24:61 Then Rebekah got up, with her maids, and they mounted the camels and followed after the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed. 
24:62 Now Isaac had come from visiting Beer-lahai-roi and was living in the land of the Negev. 
24:63 Isaac went out to meditate strolling in the field at dusk. Then he lifted up his eyes and saw, behold, camels were coming. 
24:64 Rebekah also lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac. Then she fell off her camel. 
24:65 Then she said to the servant, “Who is that man there who is walking in the field—to meet us?” The servant said, “He is my master.” So she took the veil and covered herself. 
24:66 Then the servant recounted to Isaac all the things he had done. 
24:67 Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother, took Rebekah and she became his wife—and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after the loss of his mother.
25:1 Now Abraham took another wife—her name was Keturah. 
25:2 She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah. 
25:3 Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. Dedan’s sons were Asshurim, Letushim and Leummim. 
25:4 Midian’s sons were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida and Eldaah. All of these were Keturah’s sons. 
25:5 Now Abraham gave everything that he had to Isaac, 
25:6 but to the sons of Abraham’s concubines, Abraham had given gifts and sent them away from his son Isaac while he was still living, eastward to the land of the east. 
25:7 Now these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life that he lived: 175 years. 
25:8 So Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, old and satisfied. Then he was gathered to his peoples. 
25:9 Then Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite, next to Mamre, 
25:10 the field that Abraham bought from the sons of Heth. There Abraham is buried along with Sarah his wife. 
25:11 After Abraham’s death, God blessed Isaac his son, and Isaac lived near Beer-lahai-roi. 
25:12 Now these are the genealogies of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar, Sarah’s Egyptian slave-girl, bore to Abraham. 
25:13 These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names according to their descendants: Ishmael’s firstborn, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
25:14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
25:15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedem. 
25:16 These are Ishmael’s sons and these are their names, by their unwalled and walled settlements, twelve princes according to their clans. 
25:17 These are the years of Ishmael’s life: 137 years. He breathed his last, died and was gathered to his peoples. 
25:18 Then they dwelled from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt as you go toward Assyria. Over against all his brothers he fell.
25:19 Now these are the genealogies of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham fathered Isaac. 
25:20 Isaac was 40 years old when he took for himself Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife. 
25:21  answered his plea and his wife Rebekah became pregnant. 
25:22 . 
25:23  said to her: “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from your body will be separated. One people will be stronger than the other people, but the older will serve the younger.” 
25:24 When her time came to give birth, indeed there were twins in her womb. 
25:25 Now the first came out reddish, all of him was like a fur coat, and they named him Esau. 
25:26 Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding onto Esau’s heel—so he was named Jacob. Isaac was 60 years old when he fathered them. 
25:27 When the boys grew up, Esau became a man knowledgeable in hunting, an outdoorsman, while Jacob was a mild man, remaining in tents. 
25:28 Now Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for wild game, but Rebekah loved Jacob. 
25:29 Now Jacob cooked a stew. When Esau came in from the field, he was exhausted, 
25:30 so Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me some of this really red stuff, because I’m exhausted”—that is why he is called Edom. 
25:31 So Jacob said, “Sell your birthright to me today.” 
25:32 Esau said, “Look, I’m about to die. Of whatever use is this to me—a birthright?” 
25:33 Jacob said, “Make a pledge to me now.” So he made a pledge to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob. 
25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright.
26:1 Now there was a famine in the land—aside from the previous famine that happened in Abraham’s days. So Isaac went to King Abimelech of the Philistines, to Gerar. 
26:2  appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt. Dwell in the land about which I tell you. 
26:3 Live as an outsider in this land and I will be with you and bless you—for to you and to your seed I give all these lands—and I will confirm my pledge that I swore to Abraham your father. 
26:4 I will multiply your seed like the stars of the sky and I will give your seed all these lands. And in your seed all the nations of the earth will continually be blessed, 
26:5 , My decrees, and My instructions.” 
26:6 So Isaac stayed in Gerar. 
26:7 Now the men of the place asked about his wife. So he said, “She is my sister,” because he was afraid to say, “my wife”—“or else the men of the place would kill me on account of Rebekah, because she’s good looking.” 
26:8 Now after he had been there for a long time, King Abimelech of the Philistines peered down through the window and saw, behold, Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah. 
26:9 So Abimelech called Isaac and said, “So in fact she’s your wife! Now how could you say, ‘She’s my sister’?” Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Or else I might die because of her.’” 
26:10 Then Abimelech said, “What is it that you’ve done to us? One of the people could have easily slept with your wife and you would’ve brought guilt on us.” 
26:11 So Abimelech commanded all the people saying, “Whoever touches this man or his wife will surely die!”
26:12  blessed him 
26:13 and the man became great and continued to become greater until he became very great. 
26:14 He acquired livestock of sheep and livestock of cattle, and numerous servants. Then the Philistines envied him. 
26:15 All the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham the Philistines stopped up and filled with dirt. 
26:16 So Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much more powerful than us.” 
26:17 So Isaac departed from there, camped in the Valley of Gerar and dwelled there. 
26:18 Then Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham—the Philistines had stopped them up after Abraham’s death. He gave them the same names that his father had given them. 
26:19 Then Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found a well of living water there. 
26:20 But the shepherds of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s shepherds saying, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Quarrel, because they quarreled with him. 
26:21 Then he dug another well and they quarreled over it too, so he named it Accusation. 
26:22  has created wide spaces for us and we will be fruitful in the land.” 
26:23 He went up from there to Beer-sheba. 
26:24  appeared to him that night and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you, and I will bless you and multiply your seed for the sake of Abraham my servant.” 
26:25 . He pitched his tent there and Isaac’s servants hollowed out a well there.
26:26 Now Abimelech went to him from Gerar along with Achuzzat his friend and Phicol the commander of his army. 
26:27 Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me and sent me away from you?” 
26:28  has been with you. So we said, ‘Let there now be an agreement between us—between us and you—and let us make a covenant with you: 
26:29 .” 
26:30 Then he made a feast for them and they ate and drank. 
26:31 . 
26:32 Now it happened that on that day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well that they dug, and said to him, “We’ve found water.” 
26:33 So he called it Pledge. That is why the city’s name is Beer-sheba to this day. 
26:34 When Esau was 40 years old, he took as wife Judith the daughter of Be-eri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite. 
26:35 But they caused a bitterness of spirit for Isaac and Rebekah.
27:1 Now it was when Isaac grew old and his eyes were too dim to see, that he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, “My son.” “Here I am,” he said to him. 
27:2 “Look, I’m old,” he said. “I don’t know the day of my death. 
27:3 So now, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt me some game. 
27:4 Then prepare me a delicious meal that I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, so that my soul may bless you before I die.” 
27:5 Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac was speaking to Esau his son. So while Esau went to the field to hunt game to bring in, 
27:6 Rebekah said to Jacob her son, “Look, I heard your father speaking to your brother Esau saying, 
27:7 ’s presence before my death.’ 
27:8 So now, my son, listen to my voice, to what I am commanding you. 
27:9 Go now to the flock and bring me two good young goats from there, so that I may prepare them as a delicious meal for your father—that he’ll love. 
27:10 Then you’ll bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before his death.” 
27:11 But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Look, my brother Esau is a hairy man, but I’m a smooth man. 
27:12 Perhaps my father will touch me, and he’ll take me for a mocker, and I’ll bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing.” 
27:13 Then his mother said to him, “Let your curse fall on me, my son. Just listen to me, and go, get them for me.” 
27:14 So he went and got them, and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared a delicious meal that his father would love. 
27:15 Rebekah also took her elder son Esau’s favorite clothes that were with her in the house, and she put them on her younger son Jacob, 
27:16 along with the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the hairless part of his neck. 
27:17 She put the delicious meal and the bread that she had prepared in the hand of Jacob her son. 
27:18 Then he came to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “I’m here. Who are you, my son?” 
27:19 Then Jacob said to his father, “I’m your firstborn, Esau. I’ve done just what you said to me. Sit up, please, and eat some of my wild game so that your soul may bless me.” 
27:20  your God made it happen for me.” 
27:21 Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come closer so I can feel you my son—whether or not you really are my son Esau.” 
27:22 So Jacob came closer to his father Isaac, and he felt him. Then he said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice but the hands are Esau’s hands.” 
27:23 He did not recognize him because his hands were like the hairy hands of his brother Esau. So he blessed him. 
27:24 But he said, “Are you really my son Esau?” So he said, “I am.” 
27:25 Then he said, “Bring it to me and I’ll eat some of my son’s wild game, so that my soul may bless you.” So he brought it to him and he ate, and he brought him wine and he drank. 
27:26 Then his father Isaac said to him, “Please come closer and kiss me my son.” 
27:27  has blessed. 
27:28 May God give you— from the dew of the sky and from the fatness of the land— an abundance of grain and new wine. 
27:29 May peoples serve you and may nations bow down to you. Be master over your brothers. May your mother’s sons bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and may those who bless you be blessed.” 
27:30 No sooner had Isaac finished blessing Jacob and Jacob had just gone out from his father Isaac’s presence, than Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
27:31 Then he also prepared a delicious meal and brought it to his father, and he said to his father, “Let my father get up and eat of his son’s wild game that your soul may bless me.” 
27:32 His father Isaac said, “Who are you?” And he said, “I am your son, your first-born, Esau.” 
27:33 Then Isaac trembled with intense trembling and said, “Who was it then that hunted wild game and brought it to me? I ate it all just before you came and I blessed him—and yes, he will be blessed.” 
27:34 When Esau heard his father’s words, he shouted with an intensely bitter groan. Then he said to his father, “Bless me, me too, my father!” 
27:35 Then he said, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.” 
27:36 He said, “Is this why he was named Jacob—since he’s tricked me twice already? My birthright he’s taken. Look! Now he’s taken my blessing!” Then he said, “Haven’t you saved a blessing for me?” 
27:37 Isaac answered and said to Esau, “Behold, I’ve made him master over you, and all your brothers I’ve given to him as servants. I’ve provided him with grain and new wine. What then can I do for you, my son?” 
27:38 Esau said to his father, “Do you just have one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept. 
27:39 Then Isaac his father said to him, “Behold, away from the land’s fatness shall your dwelling be, away from the dew of the sky above. 
27:40 By your sword shall you live, and your brother shall you serve. But when you tear yourself loose, you will tear his yoke off your neck.” 
27:41 So Esau bore a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, “Let the time for mourning my father draw near, so that I can kill my brother Jacob!” 
27:42 Now to Rebekah was reported the words of Esau her elder son. So she sent and called for Jacob her younger son, and said to him, “Look, your brother Esau is consoling himself about you with the thought of killing you. 
27:43 So now my son, listen to my voice. Get up—flee to Laban my brother in Haran! 
27:44 Then stay with him a few days, until your brother’s rage subsides, 
27:45 until your brother’s rage turns away from you and he forgets what you’ve done to him. Then I’ll send for you and get you back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?” 
27:46 Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I’m disgusted with my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth like these women, from the daughters of the land what is life to me?”
28:1 So Isaac called for Jacob, blessed him, commanded him and said to him, “Don’t take a wife from the daughters of Canaan. 
28:2 Get up, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother’s father, and take for yourself a wife from there, from the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother. 
28:3  bless you, and make you fruitful and multiply you so that you will become an assembly of peoples. 
28:4 And may he give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your seed with you that you may take possession of the land of your sojourn, which God gave to Abraham.” 
28:5 Then Isaac sent Jacob away and he went toward Paddan-aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau. 
28:6 Now Esau saw that Isaac blessed Jacob when he sent him to Paddan-aram to take for himself a wife from there, when he blessed him and commanded him saying, “Don’t take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.” 
28:7 Jacob listened to his father Isaac and to his mother and went toward Paddan-aram. 
28:8 Then Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were contemptible in his father Isaac’s eyes. 
28:9 So Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, Nebaioth’s sister for his wife, besides his other wives.
28:10 Then Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. 
28:11 He happened upon a certain place and spent the night there, for the sun had set. So he took one of the stones from the place and put it by his head and lay down in that place. 
28:12 He dreamed: All of a sudden, there was a stairway set up on the earth and its top reaching to the heavens—and behold, angels of God going up and down on it! 
28:13 , the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie, I will give it to you and to your seed. 
28:14 Your seed will be as the dust of the land, and you will burst forth to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south. And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed—and in your seed. 
28:15 Behold, I am with you, and I will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land, for I will not forsake you until I have done what I promised you.” 
28:16  is in this place—and I was unaware.” 
28:17 So he was afraid and said, “How fearsome this place is! This is none other than the House of God—this must be the gate of heaven!” 
28:18 Early in the morning Jacob got up and took the stone, which he had placed by his head, and set it up as a memorial stone and poured oil on top of it. 
28:19 He called the name of that place Beth-El (though originally the city’s name was Luz). 
28:20 Then Jacob made a vow saying, “If God will be with me and watch over me on this way that I am going, and provide me food to eat and clothes to wear, 
28:21  will be my God. 
28:22 So this stone which I set up as a memorial stone will become God’s House, and of everything You provide me I will definitely give a tenth of it to You.”
29:1 Then Jacob lifted up his feet and went to the land of the peoples of the east. 
29:2 When he looked, suddenly, there was a well in the field, and there were three herds of sheep resting by it. (For from that well they would water the flocks. The stone on the mouth of the well was large. 
29:3 When all the herds gathered there, they would roll away the stone from the mouth of the well and water the flocks, and put the stone back to its place over the mouth of the well.) 
29:4 Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where are you from?” “We’re from Haran,” they said. 
29:5 So he said to them, “Do you know Laban, Nahor’s son?” They said, “We know.” 
29:6 He said to them, “Is he well?” “Well,” they said. “Look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the flock.” 
29:7 He said, “Since it’s still the middle of the day, it’s not time for the livestock to be gathered. Water the flock and let them go and graze.” 
29:8 But they said, “We can’t, not until all the flocks are gathered and the stone is rolled away from the mouth of the well—then we water the flock.” 
29:9 While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with the flock that belonged to her father (for she was a shepherdess). 
29:10 Now when Jacob saw Rachel (the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother), Jacob stepped forward and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered the flock of Laban, his mother’s brother. 
29:11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept. 
29:12 Then Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s relative and that he was Rebekah’s son. So she ran and told her father. 
29:13 Now when Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet him, hugged and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Then he told Laban all these things. 
29:14 Laban said to him, “Surely you are my own bone and flesh.” And he stayed with him for a month. 
29:15 Then Laban said to Jacob, “Should you, my relative, serve me for nothing? Tell me, what should your wages be?” 
29:16 Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
29:17 Leah’s eyes were delicate, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. 
29:18 Jacob was in love with Rachel, so he said, “Let me serve you for seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.” 
29:19 Laban said, “It’s better that I give her to you than I give her to another man! Stay with me.” 
29:20 So Jacob worked for Rachel seven years, yet in his eyes it was like a few days, because of his love for her. 
29:21 Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are completed, so I may go to her.” 
29:22 So Laban gathered all the men of the place and he prepared a feast. 
29:23 When it was evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to him, and he went to her. 
29:24 Laban also gave her Zilpah his female servant to his daughter Leah as a female servant. 
29:25 So when it was morning, behold there she was, Leah! So he said to Laban, “What is this you’ve done to me? Wasn’t it for Rachel that I worked with you? So why have you deceived me?” 
29:26 But Laban said, “It’s not done so in our place—to give the younger before the first-born. 
29:27 Complete the bridal week for this one. Then we’ll also give you this other—for work that you’ll do with me—another seven years more.” 
29:28 So Jacob did; he also completed this one’s bridal week. Then he gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife. 
29:29 Laban also gave his daughter Rachel his female servant Bilhah, to be a servant for her. 
29:30 Jacob also went to Rachel and indeed loved Rachel more than Leah. So he served with him for yet another seven years. 
29:31  saw that Leah was unloved, so he opened her womb; but Rachel was unable to conceive. 
29:32  has seen my affliction. Surely now my husband will love me.” 
29:33  heard that I am hated, so He’s given me this one also,” and she named him Simeon. 
29:34 Then she became pregnant again and gave birth to a son, and said, “Now this time my husband will join himself to me because I’ve given birth to three sons for him.” For this reason he was named Levi. 
29:35 .” For this reason she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children.
30:1 When Rachel saw that she bore no children for Jacob, Rachel was jealous of her sister. So she said to Jacob, “Give me sons—if there are none, I’ll die!” 
30:2 But Jacob became furious with Rachel and said, “Am I, instead of God, the one who withheld from you the fruit of the womb?” 
30:3 So she said, “Here’s my maid-servant Bilhah. Go to her and let her give birth on my knees, so that from her I may also build a family.” 
30:4 Then she gave her maid-servant Bilhah to him for a wife, and Jacob went to her. 
30:5 Bilhah became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Jacob. 
30:6 So Rachel said, “God has judged my cause and also heard my voice—and given me a son.” Therefore she named him Dan. 
30:7 Then Rachel’s female servant became pregnant again and gave birth to a second son for Jacob. 
30:8 So Rachel said, “I’ve surely wrestled greatly with my sister — also I’ve won.” So she named him Naphtali. 
30:9 Now Leah saw that she stopped having children, so she took Zilpah her female servant and gave her to Jacob as a wife. 
30:10 Then Zilpah, Leah’s female servant, gave birth to a son for Jacob. 
30:11 Leah said, “How fortunate!” So she named him Gad. 
30:12 Then Zilpah, Leah’s female servant, gave birth to a second son for Jacob. 
30:13 Leah said, “How happy am I, for daughters have called me happy.” So she named him Asher. 
30:14 Now during the days of the wheat harvest, Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field and he brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.” 
30:15 But she said to her, “Wasn’t it enough that you took my husband away? You’d also take away my son’s mandrakes?” So Rachel said, “That being so, let him lie with you tonight, in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.” 
30:16 So when Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and she said, “You must come to me. For I’ve actually hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he lay with her that very night. 
30:17 Moreover, God heard Leah, and she became pregnant and gave birth to a fifth son for Jacob. 
30:18 Leah said, “God gave me my reward because I gave my female servant to my husband.” So she named him Issachar. 
30:19 Then Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to a sixth son for Jacob. 
30:20 Leah said, “God has presented me a good gift. This time my husband will honor me for I’ve borne six sons for him.” So she named him Zebulun. 
30:21 Afterwards she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah. 
30:22 Then God remembered Rachel and God listened to her and opened her womb. 
30:23 Then she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. So she said, “God has taken away my disgrace.” 
30:24  add another son for me.”
30:25 Now it was after Rachel gave birth to Joseph that Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away so that I can go to my place and to my land. 
30:26 Give me my wives and my children for whom I’ve served you, and let me go. For you yourself know my labor—that I’ve served you.” 
30:27  has blessed me because of you.” 
30:28 Moreover he said, “Name your own price and I’ll pay it.” 
30:29 Then he said to him, “You yourself know how I’ve served you and how your livestock fared with me. 
30:30  blessed you with my every step. So now, when am I myself going to make something for my household also?” 
30:31 Then he said, “What can I pay you?” Jacob said, “You don’t need to pay me anything. If you will do this one thing for me, I will shepherd your flock again and watch it: 
30:32 let me pass through your flock today, removing every colorfully spotted lamb from there and every dark-colored lamb among the sheep as well as the colorfully spotted among the goats—and that will be my salary. 
30:33 So tomorrow my honesty will testify on my behalf when you come to check on my salary you agreed to. Every one that isn’t colorfully spotted among the goats or dark-colored among the sheep with me, it is stolen.” 
30:34 So Laban said, “All right! May it be according to your word.” 
30:35 On that day he removed the colorfully striped and colorful billy goats as well as all the colorfully spotted goats—everyone with white on it—and every dark-colored one among the lambs, and he put them in the hand of his sons. 
30:36 Then he put a three-day’s journey between them and Jacob, while Jacob was shepherding Laban’s remaining flocks. 
30:37 But Jacob took fresh white poplar, almond, and plane tree branches, peeled away white stripped sections on them, exposing the white of the branches. 
30:38 Then he set the branches he had peeled in front of the flocks in the drinking troughs and watering channels where the flocks come to drink. Since they were in heat when they came to drink, 
30:39 the flocks mated near the branches, and the flocks gave birth to striped, spotted and colorful ones. 
30:40 Now Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped ones as well as all the dark-colored ones among Laban’s flocks. Then he set aside the herds for himself and did not put them with Laban’s flocks. 
30:41 Whenever the strong flocks mated, Jacob put the branches in the watering troughs before the eyes of the flocks, to have them mate near the branches. 
30:42 But when the flocks were sickly, he did not put the branches down—so the sickly ones became Laban’s and the stronger ones became Jacob’s. 
30:43 And the man grew exceedingly prosperous and had numerous flocks, along with female and male servants, camels and donkeys.
31:1 Now Jacob heard the words Laban’s sons were saying, “Jacob has taken everything that belongs to our father, and from what belongs to our father he has made all these riches.” 
31:2 Then Jacob saw Laban’s face, and he noticed that his expression wasn’t the same as it was just a day or two before. 
31:3  said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.” 
31:4 So Jacob sent and called for Rachel and Leah to come to the field, to his flock. 
31:5 He said to them, “I can see by your father’s face that his expression isn’t the same as it was just a day or two ago. But the God of my father has been with me. 
31:6 Now you yourselves know that I’ve served your father with all my strength. 
31:7 Yet your father has fooled around with me and has changed my salary ten times—but God hasn’t allowed him to harm me. 
31:8 If he would say, ‘the spotted ones will be your salary,’ then the flocks would give birth to spotted ones. Or if he would say, ‘the striped ones will be your salary,’ then all the flocks would give birth to striped ones. 
31:9 So God has taken away your father’s livestock and has given them to me. 
31:10 Now it happened when the flocks were in heat that I lifted up my eyes and saw, in a dream, behold, the males going up to the flocks were striped, spotted and speckled. 
31:11 .’ 
31:12 He said, ‘Lift up your eyes and see that all the males going up to the flocks are striped, spotted and speckled. For I have seen everything Laban has done to you. 
31:13 I am the God of Beth-El where you anointed a memorial stone, where you made a vow to Me. Get up now and leave this land, and return to the land of your relatives.’” 
31:14 Then Rachel answered along with Leah and they said to him, “Is there still a portion and inheritance for us in our father’s house? 
31:15 Aren’t we considered foreigners to him? For he has sold us and has also completely used up our bridal price. 
31:16 For all the riches that God has taken away from our father is for us and for our children. So now, everything God said to you, do it!” 
31:17 Then Jacob got up and put his children and wives on camels. 
31:18 He drove away all his livestock and all his possessions that he had acquired—the livestock in his possession that he acquired in Paddan-aram—to go to his father Isaac, to the land of Canaan. 
31:19 But while Laban went to shear his flocks, Rachel stole the idols that belonged to her father, 
31:20 while Jacob stole the heart from Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was fleeing. 
31:21 He himself fled with everything that belonged to him, and he got up and crossed the River, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead. 
31:22 When Laban was told on the third day after Jacob had fled, 
31:23 he took his relatives with him and pursued him a seven days’ journey. Then he overtook him in the hill country of Gilead. 
31:24 But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, “Watch yourself—lest you say anything to Jacob, good or bad.” 
31:25 So Laban caught up to Jacob. (Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, so Laban and his brothers pitched their tents in the hill country of Gilead as well). 
31:26 Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you’ve stolen my heart and have driven my daughters away like captives of the sword? 
31:27 Why did you secretly flee away, and steal from me? Why didn’t you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and with songs, with tambourines and with lyres? 
31:28 And you didn’t even let me kiss my sons and daughters! “Now, you’ve behaved foolishly. 
31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do evil with you, but yesterday the God of your fathers spoke to me, saying, ‘Watch yourself—lest you say anything to Jacob, good or bad.’ 
31:30 So now, when you up and left because you really missed your father’s house, why did you steal my gods?” 
31:31 In response, Jacob said to Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I thought, ‘Suppose you snatch your daughters away from me.’ 
31:32 Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live. In front of our relatives, identify whatever is yours that is with me, and take it back.” (But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.) 
31:33 So Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and Leah’s tent and into the tent of the two maids, but he found nothing. Then he went out of Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent. 
31:34 (Now Rachel had taken the idols, put them in the camel’s saddlebag and sat on them.) So Laban felt around the entire tent but did not find them. 
31:35 She said to her father, “Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for I am having the way of women.” So he searched but did not find the idols. 
31:36 Then Jacob got angry and argued with Laban. Jacob answered and said to Laban, “What’s my crime? What’s my sin that you’ve hotly pursued me? 
31:37 For you’ve felt through all my things. What did you find? Any of your household things? Put them here, in front of my relatives and yours—so they can decide between the two of us. 
31:38 These past twenty years I’ve been with you, your ewes and female goats have never miscarried, and I’ve never eaten the rams of your flock. 
31:39 I didn’t bring you animals torn by wild beasts. I myself would bear the loss. You would require it from my hand, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. 
31:40 I was consumed by heat during the day, consumed by frost during the night, and my sleep fled from my eyes. 
31:41 This is how it’s been for me twenty years in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flocks—and you changed my salary ten times! 
31:42 Had I not had the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, you would have sent me away empty-handed now. But God saw my misery and the toil of my hands and last night He became the Judge.” 
31:43 In response Laban said to Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flocks are my flocks. Everything you see is mine. But what can I do for these, my daughters, today, or for their sons to whom they’ve given birth? 
31:44 So now, come, let’s make a covenant, you and I, and let it be a witness between you and me.” 
31:45 So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar, 
31:46 and Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” So they took the stones and made a pile. Then they ate there on the pile. 
31:47 Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha and Jacob called it Gal-ed. 
31:48 And Laban said, “This pile is a witness between me and you today.” That is why its name is Gal-ed, 
31:49  keep watch between you and me when we are out of one another’s sight. 
31:50 If you mistreat my daughters, and if you take wives besides my daughters, though no one is with us, look! God is the witness between you and me.” 
31:51 Laban said further to Jacob, “Behold, this pile, and this pillar which I’ve set up between you and me: 
31:52 this pile serves as a witness, that I won’t pass by this pillar to go to you, and that you won’t pass by this pile and this pillar to go to me—with evil intent. 
31:53 May the God of Abraham and the gods of Nahor, the gods of their father, judge between us.” Jacob also made an oath by the fear of his father Isaac. 
31:54 Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and he invited his relatives to eat bread. So they ate bread and spent the night on the mountain.
31:55
32:1 Early in the morning Laban got up, kissed his grandchildren and daughters and blessed them. Then Laban left and returned to his place. 
32:2 While Jacob left on his way, the angels of God met him. 
32:3 Then Jacob said when he saw them, “This is God’s camp,” and he named that place Mahanaim.
32:4 Then Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom. 
32:5 He also commanded them saying, “This is what you should say to my lord, to Esau: ‘This is what your servant Jacob said: I’ve been staying with Laban, and have lingered until now. 
32:6 Now I’ve come to possess oxen and donkeys, flocks, male servants and female servants. I sent word to tell my lord, in order to find favor in your eyes.’” 
32:7 The messengers returned to Jacob saying, “We went to your brother, to Esau, and he’s also coming out to meet you—and 400 men with him.” 
32:8 So Jacob became extremely afraid and distressed. He divided the people with him, along with the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps, 
32:9 for he thought, “If Esau comes to one camp and strikes it, the camp that’s left will escape.” 
32:10 , who said to me, ‘Return to your land and to your relatives and I will do good with you.’ 
32:11 I am unworthy of all the proofs of mercy and of all the dependability that you have shown to your servant. For with only my staff I crossed over this Jordan, and now I’ve become two camps. 
32:12 Deliver me, please, from my brother’s hand, from Esau’s hand, for I’m afraid of him that he’ll come and strike me—the mothers with the children. 
32:13 You Yourself said, ‘I will most certainly do good with you, and will make your seed like the sand of the sea that cannot be counted because of its abundance.’” 
32:14 So he stayed overnight there. Then from all that had come into his possession he took an offering for Esau his brother: 
32:15  200 female goats, 20 billy goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams, 
32:16  30 milking camels with their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 male donkeys. 
32:17 He put them in the hands of his servants, each herd by itself, and he said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put a gap between each of the herds.” 
32:18 Then he commanded the first one saying, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks you saying, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and to whom do all these before you belong?’ 
32:19 then you are to say, ‘To your servant, to Jacob—it’s an offering sent to my lord, to Esau. And look, he’s also behind us.’” 
32:20 And he also commanded the second one, the third one, and all those who were going behind the flocks, saying, “Say the same exact thing to Esau when you find him. 
32:21 Then you are to say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is also behind us.’” For he thought, “Let me appease him with the offering that goes ahead of me, and afterward see his face, perhaps he’ll lift up my face.” 
32:22 So the offering passed over ahead of him, while he spent that night in the camp. 
32:23 Then he got up that night and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok. 
32:24 He took them and sent them across the stream, and he sent across whatever he had. 
32:25 So Jacob remained all by himself. Then a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn. 
32:26 When He saw that He had not overcome him, He struck the socket of his hip, so He dislocated the socket of Jacob’s hip when He wrestled with him. 
32:27 Then He said, “Let Me go, for the dawn has broken.” But he said, “I won’t let You go unless You bless me.” 
32:28 Then He said to him, “What is your name?” “Jacob,” he said. 
32:29 Then He said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but rather Israel, for you have struggled with God and with men, and you have overcome.” 
32:30 Then Jacob asked and said, “Please tell me Your name.” But He said, “What’s this—you are asking My name?” Then He blessed him there. 
32:31 So Jacob named the place Peniel, “for I’ve seen God face to face, and my life has been spared.” 
32:32 Now the sun rose upon him just as he crossed by Peniel—limping because of his hip. 
33:1 Then Jacob glanced up and saw, behold, there was Esau coming—and 400 men with him. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two female servants. 
33:2 He put the female servants and their children first, then Leah and her children behind them, then Rachel and Joseph behind them. 
33:3 But he himself passed on ahead of them, and bowed to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother. 
33:4 But Esau ran to meet him, hugged him, fell on his neck and kissed him—and they wept. 
33:5 His eyes glanced up and he saw the women and the children, and said, “Who are these with you?” “The children whom God has graciously given your servant,” he said. 
33:6 Then the female servants approached, they and their children, and bowed down. 
33:7 Leah also approached, along with her children, and they bowed down, and finally, Joseph and Rachel approached and bowed down. 
33:8 “What do you mean by this whole caravan that I’ve met?” So he said, “To find favor in your eyes, my lord.” 
33:9 But Esau said, “I have plenty! O my brother, do keep all that belongs to you.” 
33:10 Yet Jacob said, “No, please! If I have found favor in your eyes, then you will take my offering from my hand. For this is the reason I’ve seen your face—it is like seeing the face of God—and you’ve accepted me! 
33:11 Please, take my blessing that was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me, and because I have everything.” So he kept urging him until he accepted. 
33:12 Then he said, “Let’s journey and be on our way, and I’ll go ahead of you. 
33:13 He continued, “My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and the cattle in my care are nursing. So if they were pushed hard just one day, all the flocks would die. 
33:14 Please, let my lord pass on ahead of your servant, and I’ll move on further gradually, at a pace suited to the livestock that are before me and at a pace suited to the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.” 
33:15 Then Esau said, “Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But he said, “What’s this? Let me find favor in my lord’s eyes.” 
33:16 So on that day Esau returned on his way to Seir, 
33:17 but Jacob journeyed to Sukkot and built a house for himself, and for his livestock he made booths. That is the reason that place is called Sukkot. 
33:18  to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram, and camped right in front of the city. 
33:19 He purchased the portion of the field there where he had pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for 100 pieces of money. 
33:20 There he set up an altar, and he called it, El is Israel’s God.
34:1 Now Dinah, Leah’s daughter whom she bore for Jacob, went out to look at the daughters of the land. 
34:2 When Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he took her and lay with her and raped her. 
34:3 But his soul clung to Dinah, Jacob’s daughter, and he loved the young woman and spoke reassuringly to the young woman. 
34:4 So Shechem said to his father Hamor saying, “Get me this girl for a wife.” 
34:5 Now Jacob had heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah while his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob kept quiet until they came in. 
34:6 Meanwhile Shechem’s father Hamor went out to Jacob in order to speak with him. 
34:7 Jacob’s sons had already come in from the field when they heard, and the men were deeply grieved and furious, because he had committed a vile deed in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter, which ought never to be done. 
34:8 But Hamor spoke with them saying, “My son Shechem—he’s very attached to your daughter. Please give her to him for a wife. 
34:9 Intermarry with us. You can give your daughters to us, and you can take our daughters for yourselves. 
34:10 You can live with us, and the land will be open to you: live in it, move about freely in it, and settle down in it.” 
34:11 Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, “Would that I find favor in your eyes! Whatever you say to me I’ll give. 
34:12 Set the dowry and the presents as high as you like and I’ll give whatever you say to me. But give me the young woman as a wife.” 
34:13 But Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully as they spoke, because he had defiled their sister Dinah. 
34:14 They said to them, “We can’t do this thing—give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised—for this is a disgrace to us. 
34:15 Only by this will we consent to you: if you will become like us, by circumcising every male. 
34:16 Then we’ll give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves, and live with you, and become one people. 
34:17 But if you don’t listen to us and be circumcised, we’ll take our daughter and leave.” 
34:18 Now their words seemed good to Hamor as well as Hamor’s son Shechem. 
34:19 So the young man did not hesitate to do it, since he delighted in Jacob’s daughter. Now he was honored above everyone else in his father’s house. 
34:20 So Hamor and his son Shechem came into the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying: 
34:21 “These men are enjoying a peaceful relationship with us and they are living in the land and moving about freely in it. As for the land, look, it’s spread out on both sides before us. We can take their daughters to be our wives, and we can give our daughters to them. 
34:22 But by this did these men consent to us, to live with us and to become one people—when all our males are circumcised as they are circumcised. 
34:23 Their livestock and their possessions: won’t they be ours? Only let us consent to them so that they’ll live with us.” 
34:24 Now everyone who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, every one who went out the gate of his city. 
34:25 Then on the third day while they were in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword and came against the city undisturbed and killed every male. 
34:26 Hamor and his son Shechem they killed with the sword, then took Dinah from Shechem’s house and left. 
34:27 Jacob’s sons came upon the slain and plundered the city because they defiled their sister. 
34:28 They took their flocks, their cattle and their donkeys, those that were in the city as well as those that were in the field. 
34:29 All their wealth, their little children, and their wives they captured and plundered, as well as everything that was in the houses. 
34:30 But Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You’ve brought trouble on me, making me a stench among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am but a few men—they’ll gather against me and strike me—then I’ll be destroyed, my household and I.” 
34:31 But they said, “Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?”
35:1 Then God said to Jacob, “Get up! Go up to Beth-El and stay there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.” 
35:2 So Jacob said to his household and to everyone who was with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods that are among you. Cleanse yourselves and change your clothes. 
35:3 Now let’s get up and go up to Beth-El so that I can make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and has been with me in the way that I have gone.” 
35:4 So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods in their hand and the rings in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak tree near Shechem. 
35:5 Then they journeyed, and the terror of God was on the cities that were around them, so they did not pursue Jacob’s sons. 
35:6 Then Jacob arrived at Luz in the land of Canaan (that is Beth-El), he and all the people who were with him. 
35:7 He built an altar there and called the place El-Beth-El because God had revealed Himself to him there when he fled from the presence of his brother. 
35:8 Then Rebekah’s nurse Deborah died, and was buried below Beth-El, under the oak—so it was named Oak of Weeping. 
35:9 God appeared to Jacob again, after he returned from Paddan-aram, and He blessed him. 
35:10 God said to him: “Your name was Jacob. No longer will your name be Jacob, for your name will be Israel.” So He named him Israel. 
35:11 . Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and an assembly of nations will come from you. From your loins will come forth kings. 
35:12 The land that I gave to Abraham and to Isaac— I give it to you, and to your seed after you I will give the land.” 
35:13 Then God went up from him at the place where He had spoken with him. 
35:14 Jacob set up a memorial stone in the place where He had spoken with him—a stone pillar—and he poured a drink offering on it and poured oil on it. 
35:15 Jacob named the place where God spoke with him Beth-El.
35:16 Then they traveled from Beth-El, and while they were still a distance from entering Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth, but her labor was difficult. 
35:17 While she was struggling to give birth, the midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for this is also a son for you.” 
35:18 Now as her soul was departing (for she died), she named him Ben-Oni, but his father named him Benjamin. 
35:19 Then Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 
35:20 Jacob set up a memorial stone over her grave. (It is the memorial stone over Rachel’s grave to this day.)
35:21 Then Israel journeyed on and set up his tent beyond the tower of Eder. 
35:22 While Israel was living in that land, Reuben went and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard about it. Now Jacob had twelve sons. 
35:23 Leah’s sons were Jacob’s firstborn Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun. 
35:24 Rachel’s sons were Joseph and Benjamin. 
35:25 The sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s female servant, were Dan and Naphtali, 
35:26 and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s female servant, were Gad and Asher. These are Jacob’s sons, who were born to him in Paddan-aram. 
35:27 Then Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre of Kiriat-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed. 
35:28 Now Isaac’s days were 180 years. 
35:29 Then Isaac breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his peoples, old and full of days. So his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
36:1 Now these are the genealogies of Esau (that is, Edom). 
36:2 Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, Oholibamah daughter of Anah, daughter of Tzivion the Hivite, 
36:3 and Basemath daughter of Ishmael, sister of Nebaioth. 
36:4 Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel, 
36:5 and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were Esau’s sons, who were born to him in the land of Canaan. 
36:6 Now Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters and all the people of his household, as well as his livestock, all his cattle, and all his possessions that he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went to a land away from his brother Jacob. 
36:7 For their possessions were too numerous for them to dwell together, and the land where they were residing was unable to support them because of their livestock. 
36:8 So Esau lived in Mount Seir (Esau is Edom). 
36:9 So these are the genealogies of Esau, the father of Edom in the hill country of Seir. 
36:10 These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz son of Esau’s wife Adah and Reuel son of Esau’s wife Basemath. 
36:11 The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam and Kenaz. 
36:12 Now Timna was a concubine to Esau’s son Eliphaz, and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These are the sons of Esau’s wife Adah. 
36:13 These are Reuel’s sons: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the sons of Esau’s wife Basemath. 
36:14 These were the sons of Oholibamah, daughter of Anah, daughter of Esau’s wife Zibion—she bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam and Korah. 
36:15 These are the chiefs from Esau’s sons. The sons of Eliphaz, Esau’s firstborn were chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz, 
36:16 chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek. These are the chiefs from Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Adah. 
36:17 These are the sons of Esau’s son Reuel: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are chiefs from Reuel in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Esau’s wife Basemath. 
36:18 These are the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah. These are the chiefs from Oholibamah, daughter of Esau’s wife Anah. 
36:19 These are Esau’s sons, and these are their chiefs (that is, Edom). 
36:20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
36:21 Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom. 
36:22 The sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam. Lotan’s sister is Timna. 
36:23 These are Shobal’s sons: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho and Onam. 
36:24 These are Zibeon’s sons: Aiah and Anah (that is, the Anah who found the hot springs in the desert while he was pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon). 
36:25 These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah, Anah’s daughter. 
36:26 These are Dishon’s sons: Hemdan, Eshban, Itran and Cheran. 
36:27 These are Ezer’s sons: Bilhan, Zaavan and Akan. 
36:28 These are Dishan’s sons: Uz and Aran. 
36:29 These are the chiefs of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Tzivion, chief Anah, 
36:30 chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan—these are the chiefs of the Horites according to their chiefly divisions in the land of Seir. 
36:31 Now these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the sons of Israel. 
36:32 Bela son of Beor reigned in Edom—the name of his city was Dinhabah. 
36:33 When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his place. 
36:34 When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites reigned in his place. 
36:35 When Husham died, Haddad son of Bedad, who struck down the Midianites in the field of Moab, reigned in his place—the name of his city was Avit. 
36:36 When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah reigned in his place. 
36:37 When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehovot by the River reigned in his place. 
36:38 When Shaul died, Baal-hanan son of Achbor reigned in his place. 
36:39 When Baal-hanan son of Achbor died, Hadar reigned in his place—the name of his city is Pau, and his wife’s name is Mehetabel, daughter of Matred, daughter of Me-zehab. 
36:40 Now these are the names of the chiefs from Esau according to their family divisions, according to their places, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth, 
36:41 chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon, 
36:42 chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar, 
36:43 chief Magdiel, chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom according to their places of residence in the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father of Edom.
37:1 Now Jacob dwelled in the land where his father had sojourned, in the land of Canaan. 
37:2 These are the genealogies of Jacob. When Joseph was 17 years old (he was a youth), he was shepherding the flocks with his brothers—with the sons of his father’s wives Bilhah and Zilpah. Joseph brought back a bad report about them to their father. 
37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his other sons because he was the son of his old age. So he had made him a long-sleeved tunic. 
37:4 . 
37:5 Then Joseph dreamed a dream and told his brothers—and they hated him even more. 
37:6 He said to them, “Please listen to this dream I dreamed. 
37:7 There we were binding sheaves in the middle of the field. All of a sudden, my sheaf arose and stood upright. And behold, your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf.” 
37:8 “Will you truly be a king over us?” his brothers said to him. “Will you really rule over us?” So they hated him even more because of his dreams and because of his words. 
37:9 But then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers, saying, “I have just dreamed another dream. Suddenly, there was the sun and the moon and the eleven stars bowing down to me!” 
37:10 He told it to his father as well as his brothers. Then his father rebuked him and said to him, “What’s this dream you dreamed? Will we really come—your mother and I with your brothers—to bow down to the ground to you?” 
37:11 So his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the speech in mind.
37:12 Then his brothers went to graze their father’s flocks at Shechem. 
37:13 Israel said to Joseph, “Aren’t your brothers grazing the flocks in Shechem? Come, let me send you to them.” “Here I am,” he said to him. 
37:14 Then he said to him, “Go now, and check on the welfare of your brothers and the welfare of the flocks and bring word back to me.” So he sent him from the valley of Hebron and he went to Shechem. 
37:15 A man found him there, wandering in the field, and the man asked him, “What are you looking for?” 
37:16 “I’m looking for my brothers,” he said. “Please tell me where they’re grazing.” 
37:17 The man said, “They moved on from here. For I heard them saying, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan. 
37:18 Now they saw him from a distance. Before he was close to them they plotted together against him in order to kill him. 
37:19 They said to one another, “Here comes the master of dreams! 
37:20 Come on now! Let’s kill him and throw him into one of those pits, so we can say that an evil animal devoured him. Then let’s see what becomes of his dreams.” 
37:21 But Reuben heard and rescued him out of their hands, saying, “We must not beat him to death.” 
37:22 In order to rescue him from their hand and to return him to his father, Reuben said to them, “Don’t shed blood! Throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but don’t lay a hand on him!” 
37:23 So as soon as Joseph came up to his brothers they stripped Joseph of his tunic (the long sleeved tunic that he had on). 
37:24 Then they took him and threw him into the pit. (Now the pit was empty, with no water in it.) 
37:25 Then they sat down to eat bread. When they looked up, behold, there was a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels carrying gum, balsam, and myrrh—going to bring them down to Egypt. 
37:26 Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is there if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? Come on! 
37:27 Let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites. Let’s not lay our hand on him—since he’s our brother, our own flesh.” His brothers listened to him. 
37:28 When some men, Midianite merchants, passed by, they dragged Joseph up and out of the pit and they sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver, and they brought Joseph to Egypt. 
37:29 When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his clothes. 
37:30 Then he returned to his brothers and said, “The boy is gone! And I—where should I go?” 
37:31 So they took Joseph’s tunic, slaughtered a billy goat, and they dipped the tunic into the blood. 
37:32 Then they sent the long-sleeved tunic, and it was brought to their father, and they said, “We found this. Do you recognize whether or not it is your son’s tunic?” 
37:33 He did recognize it and said, “My son’s tunic! An evil animal has devoured him! Joseph must be torn to pieces!” 
37:34 Jacob tore his clothing and put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days. 
37:35  to my son, mourning.” So his father kept weeping for him. 
37:36 Meanwhile the Midianites sold him into Egypt, to Potiphar an official of Pharaoh, the commander of the bodyguards.
38:1 About that time Judah went down from his brothers and he camped near an Adullamite man, whose name was Hirah. 
38:2 There Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man whose name was Shua, and he took her as wife and slept with her. 
38:3 Then she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and he named him Er. 
38:4 She became pregnant again and gave birth to a son, and she named him Onan. 
38:5 She gave birth to yet another son and she called him Shelah. He was in Chezib when she gave birth to him. 
38:6 Then Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 
38:7  put him to death. 
38:8 Then Judah said to Onan, go to your brother’s wife to perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up a seed for your brother. 
38:9 But Onan knew that the seed would not be his. So every time he went to his brother’s wife he would destroy it on the ground so as not to provide a seed for his brother. 
38:10 ’s eyes, so He put him to death also. 
38:11 Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Stay as a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up,” because he thought, “Otherwise he too might die, like his brothers.” So Tamar went and stayed in her father’s house. 
38:12 Now the days became many, and Shua’s daughter, Judah’s wife, died. After Judah consoled himself, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 
38:13 Then Tamar was told, “Look! Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his flocks.” 
38:14 And she removed her widow’s clothes from herself, covered herself with a veil, wrapped herself, and sat by the entrance to the springs on the way to Timnah (for she saw that Shelah had grown up and she had not been given to him as a wife). 
38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute because she had covered her face. 
38:16 So he turned aside to her along the way and said, “Please let me sleep with you” (for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law). “What,” she asked, “will you give me to sleep with me?” 
38:17 “I will send you a young goat from the flock,” he said, “Provided you give a pledge until you send it,” she said. 
38:18 “What kind of pledge shall I give you?” he asked. “Your seal, and your cord, and your staff in your hand,” she said. So he gave them to her and he slept with her, and she got pregnant by him. 
38:19 After she got up and left, she removed her veil from herself and put on her widow’s clothes. 
38:20 When Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite to take back the pledge from the woman’s hand, he could not find her. 
38:21 He asked the men of her area saying, “Where is the cult prostitute? She was at the springs along the way.” But they said, “There hasn’t been a cult prostitute here.” 
38:22 So he returned to Judah and said, “I couldn’t find her, and the people of that place also said, ‘There hasn’t been a cult prostitute here.’” 
38:23 Then Judah said, “Let her take them for herself, or we’ll be held in contempt. Behold, I did send this young goat, but you couldn’t find her.” 
38:24 About three months later, Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has been a prostitute—look, she’s even pregnant by prostitution.” “Bring her out!” Judah said, “and let her be burned.” 
38:25 As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law saying, “I’m pregnant by the man to whom these things belong.” Then she said, “Do you recognize whose these are—the seal, the cords and the staff?” 
38:26 Then Judah recognized them and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I didn’t give her to my son Shelah.” He was not intimate with her again. 
38:27 Now when it was time for her to give birth, behold there were twins in her womb. 
38:28 While she was giving birth, one stuck out his hand, and the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it to his hand saying, “This one came out first.” 
38:29 But as he was pulling his hand back in, behold, his brother came out. So she said, “How you have broken through! The breach is because of you.” And he named him Perez. 
38:30 Afterward his brother, on whose hand was the scarlet thread, came out. And he named him Zerah.
39:1 Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an official of Pharaoh, commander of the bodyguards, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down there. 
39:2  was with Joseph. So he became a successful man in the house of his master, the Egyptian. 
39:3  made everything he set his hand to successful. 
39:4 Joseph found favor in his eyes, so he served him as a personal servant and he made him an overseer over his household; everything that was his he entrusted into his hand. 
39:5 ’s blessing was on everything that belonged to him, in the house and in the field. 
39:6 So he released everything he owned into Joseph’s hand. With him in charge, he did not think about anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and handsome in appearance. 
39:7 Now after these things, the master’s wife lifted up her eyes at Joseph and said, “Come, lie down with me!” 
39:8 But he refused. “Look,” he said to his master’s wife, “my master doesn’t think about anything in the house with me in charge, and everything that belongs to him he’s entrusted into my hand. 
39:9 No one in this house is greater than I, and he has withheld nothing from me—except you, because you are his wife. So how could I commit this great evil and sin against God?” 
39:10 So whenever she spoke to Joseph, day after day, he did not listen to her invitation to lie down beside her, to be with her. 
39:11 Now on one such day, he came into the house to do his work, and none of the people of the house were there in the house. 
39:12 Then she grabbed him by his garment saying, “Come, lie with me!” But he left his garment in her hand, fled and went outside. 
39:13 When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and fled outside, 
39:14 she screamed to the men of her house and said to them, “Look! Someone brought a Hebrew man to us to fool with us. He approached me to lie with me so I screamed out loud. 
39:15 When he heard me raise my voice and scream, he left his garment with me, fled and went outside.” 
39:16 Then she kept the garment with her until his master came home. 
39:17 She spoke the same words to him saying, “The Hebrew slave that you brought us approached me to fool with me. 
39:18 When I raised my voiced and screamed, he left his garment with me and fled outside.” 
39:19 Now when his master heard the words his wife spoke to him saying, “Such are the things your slave did to me,” his anger burned. 
39:20 Then Joseph’s master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. So there he was, in the prison. 
39:21  was with Joseph and extended kindness to him and gave him favor in the eyes of the commander of the prison. 
39:22 The commander of the prison entrusted into Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison, so that everything that was done there, he was responsible for it. 
39:23  made whatever he did successful.
40:1 Now it was after these things that the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt. 
40:2 Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, with the chief of the cupbearers and with the chief of the bakers. 
40:3 So he put them in custody of the house of the commander of the bodyguards—in the prison, the place where Joseph was confined. 
40:4 The commander of the bodyguards assigned Joseph to be with them and served them as their personal servant. They were in custody for some time. 
40:5 Then the two of them each dreamed a dream on the same night. The dream of each man—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison—each had its own interpretation. 
40:6 When Joseph came to them in the morning, he observed them, and there they were, looking miserable. 
40:7 So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were with him in the custody of the house of his master saying, “Why are your faces so sad today?” 
40:8 They said to him, “We dreamed a dream and there is no one to interpret it.” Then Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Please tell me.” 
40:9 So the chief of the cupbearers told his dream to Joseph, saying to him, “In my dream, suddenly, there was a vine in front of me. 
40:10 On the vine were three branches, and as it was budding, its blossoms came out, its clusters ripened into grapes. 
40:11 Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand and I took the grapes, pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup and put the cup in Pharaoh’s palm.” 
40:12 “This is its interpretation,” Joseph said to him. “The three branches: they are three days. 
40:13 In another three days, Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position. Then you’ll put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand just as you used to do before when you were his cupbearer. 
40:14 But if you remember me, that I was with you, when it goes well with you, please show me kindness and mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this house. 
40:15 For I was forcibly kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing at all that they should put me in this pit.” 
40:16 When the chief of the bakers saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, “I also was in my dream. Expectantly, there were three baskets of white bread on my head. 
40:17 In the top basket was food for Pharaoh—all kinds of baked goods. But the birds were eating them from the basket on my head.” 
40:18 Then Joseph answered and said, “This is its interpretation. The three baskets: they are three days. 
40:19 In another three days Pharaoh will lift up your head—off of you—and will hang you on a tree. Then the birds will eat your flesh off of you.” 
40:20 Then it happened on the third day—Pharaoh’s birthday—that he held a banquet for all his servants. He lifted up the head of the chief of the cupbearers and the head of the chief of the bakers among his servants. 
40:21 He restored the chief of the cupbearers as his cupbearer, and he put the cup on the palm of Pharaoh’s hand. 
40:22 But the chief of the bakers he hung. It was just as Joseph had interpreted for them. 
40:23 Yet the chief of the cupbearers did not remember Joseph—indeed, he forgot him.
41:1 Now at the end of two whole years, Pharaoh was dreaming. Behold, there he was standing by the Nile. 
41:2 Then behold, there were seven cows, good-looking and beefy, and they grazed in the reeds. 
41:3 Then behold, there were seven other cows coming up after them from the Nile, ugly and emaciated, and they stood beside the cows at the edge of the Nile. 
41:4 Then the ugly emaciated cows ate the seven good-looking beefy cows—and Pharaoh woke up. 
41:5 Then he slept and dreamed a second time: behold, there were seven ears of corn coming up on one stalk, plump and good. 
41:6 Then behold, there were seven ears of corn, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouting up after them. 
41:7 Then the seven thin ears of corn swallowed up the seven plump and full ears of corn. Then Pharaoh woke up—it was a dream. 
41:8 But in the morning he was disturbed in his spirit. So he sent and called for the fortune-telling priests of Egypt and all its wise men and Pharaoh told them his dream. But no one could interpret them for Pharaoh. 
41:9 Then the chief of the cupbearers spoke with Pharaoh saying, “I am reminded of my sins today. 
41:10 Pharaoh had been angry with his servants and put me in the custody of the house of the commander of the bodyguards—me and the chief of the bakers. 
41:11 Then we each dreamed a dream on the same night, he and I, we both dreamed, yet each dream had its own interpretation. 
41:12 Now there with us was a Hebrew youth—a slave belonging to the commander of the bodyguards. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams for us, each man’s dream he interpreted. 
41:13 Then it came about, just as he interpreted for us, so it happened. Me he restored to my position, but him he hung. 
41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph. So they quickly fetched him from the pit. He shaved, changed his clothes, and came to Pharaoh. 
41:15 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I dreamed a dream and there’s no one to interpret it. I heard about you— it’s said that you can listen to a dream to interpret it.” 
41:16  for Pharaoh.” 
41:17 So Pharaoh said to Joseph: “In my dream, there I was, standing by the bank of the Nile. 
41:18 And to my surprise, out of the Nile seven cows were coming up, beefy and good-looking, and they grazed in the reeds. 
41:19 Then all of a sudden, there were seven other cows coming up after them, feeble, very ugly and emaciated. I’ve never seen the likes of these in the whole land of Egypt for ugliness. 
41:20 Then the emaciated and ugly cows ate the first seven beefy cows. 
41:21 When they were devoured, one couldn’t tell that they had been devoured. Their appearance was as ugly as it was at first. Then I woke up. 
41:22 Then I saw in my dream, there were seven ears of corn coming up on one stalk, plump and good. 
41:23 Then suddenly, there were seven ears of corn, dried up, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouting up after them. 
41:24 Then the thin ears of corn swallowed up the seven good ears of corn. So I told the fortune-telling priests, but no one could provide me with an explanation.” 
41:25 Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh’s dream is one. God has told Pharaoh what He is about to do. 
41:26 The seven good cows: they are seven years. Also the seven ears of corn: they’re seven years. It is one dream. 
41:27 The seven emaciated and ugly cows coming up after them: they’re seven years. Also the seven empty ears of corn scorched by the east wind: there will be seven years of famine. 
41:28 It is the word that I have already said to Pharaoh: what God is about to do, he has shown to Pharaoh. 
41:29 Seven years of abundance are about to come in the whole land of Egypt. 
41:30 Then seven years of famine will come up after them and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten and the famine will consume the land. 
41:31 So the abundance in the land will be unknown because of the famine that follows, for it will be a very oppressive famine. 
41:32 “Now as for repeating Pharaoh’s dream twice: it’s because the matter has been settled by God and God will quickly make it happen. 
41:33 So now, let Pharaoh select a man discerning and wise and set him in authority over the land of Egypt. 
41:34 Let Pharaoh act by appointing administrators over the land and take a fifth portion from the land of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. 
41:35 Then let them gather all the food from these good years that are coming, and let them store up grain under Pharaoh’s hand as food for the cities, so they may preserve it. 
41:36 Let the food be held in reserve for the land for the seven years of famine that is coming upon the land of Egypt. Then the land will not be annihilated by the famine.” 
41:37 Now the plan seemed good in the eyes of Pharaoh as well as all his servants. 
41:38 Then Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can a man like this be found, one in whom is God’s Spirit?” 
41:39 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one as discerning and wise as you. 
41:40 You! You will be over my house, and all my people will pay homage to you . Only in relation to the throne will I be greater than you.” 
41:41 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I appoint you over the whole land of Egypt.” 
41:42 Then Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand, clothed him with fine linen garments, and put a chain of gold around his neck. 
41:43 Then he had him ride in the chariot as second-in-command, the one that belonged to him, and they called out before him, “Kneel down!” So he appointed him over the whole land of Egypt. 
41:44 Pharaoh also said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, yet without your permission no one will lift up his hand or his foot in the whole land of Egypt.” 
41:45 Then Pharaoh named Joseph Zaphenath-paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, as his wife. Then Joseph went out, in charge of the land of Egypt. 
41:46 Now Joseph was 30 years old when he began serving as representative of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Joseph went out from Pharaoh’s presence and passed throughout the whole land of Egypt. 
41:47 During the seven years of abundance, the land produced in heaps. 
41:48 So he gathered all the food in the land of Egypt during the seven years, and put food in the cities; the food from the city fields surrounding the cities he put in each city. 
41:49 So Joseph stored up grain like the sand of the sea, vast amounts, until he stopped keeping record because it was beyond counting. 
41:50 Two sons also had been born to Joseph before the year of famine came, born to him by Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. 
41:51 Joseph named his first-born Manasseh, “because God has caused me to forget all my trouble and all my father’s house.” 
41:52 And the second he named Ephraim, “because God has made me fruitful in the land of my oppression.” 
41:53 Then the seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt came to an end, 
41:54 and the seven years of famine started to come—just as Joseph had said. So there was famine in all the lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was bread. 
41:55 When the whole land of Egypt suffered famine, the people cried out to Pharaoh for food, and Pharaoh said to all of Egypt, “Go to Joseph. Do whatever he tells you.” 
41:56 The famine was over all the entire land, so Joseph opened up all that was among them and sold grain to Egypt. Then the famine became severe in the land of Egypt. 
41:57 Yet the whole world came to Egypt to buy grain—to Joseph—because the famine was severe in the whole world.
42:1 Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, so Jacob said to his sons, “Why are you looking at each other?” 
42:2 Then he said, “Look! I’ve heard that there’s grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some grain for us there so that we’ll live and not die.” 
42:3 So Joseph’s brothers went down, ten of them, to buy grain from Egypt. 
42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob did not send, for he said, “An accident might happen to him.” 
42:5 The sons of Israel went to buy grain among the others who were coming, because the famine was in the land of Canaan. 
42:6 Now Joseph was the ruler over the land. He was the provider of grain for all the people of the earth. 
42:7 Then Joseph’s brothers came and bowed down to him with faces to the ground. When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he made himself unrecognizable to them. Then he spoke harshly and said to them, “Where have you come from?” “From the land of Canaan,” they said, “to buy grain as food.” 
42:8 Though Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him. 
42:9 Then Joseph remembered the dreams he had dreamed about them. He said to them, “You’re spies! You’ve come to see the undefended places in the land.” 
42:10 “No, my lord!” they said to him. “Your servants came to buy grain as food. 
42:11 All of us—we are sons of one man. We’re honest. Your servants have never been spies.” 
42:12 “Not so,” he said to them. “Rather, you’ve come to see the undefended places in the land.” 
42:13 But they said, “We your servants are twelve brothers, sons of one man in the land of Canaan. Look, the youngest is with our father today and the other one is no more.” 
42:14 Joseph said to them, “It’s just like I told you when I said, ‘You’re spies.’ 
42:15 By this you’ll be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you’ll not leave from here until your youngest brother comes here! 
42:16 Send one from among yourselves to get your brother, while you remain confined, in order to test your words, to see whether the truth is with you. If not, by the life of Pharaoh, you’re definitely spies!” 
42:17 So he put them together in custody for three days. 
42:18 Then Joseph said to them on the third day, “Do this and you will live. I fear God. 
42:19 If you’re honest, let one of your brothers remain as a prisoner in the guardhouse where you’ve been, while you, go and bring grain for the hunger in your homes. 
42:20 And your youngest brother, bring to me so that your words can be verified—and you won’t die.” So they did. 
42:21 Then each man said to his brother, “We’re truly guilty for our brother. We saw the distress of his soul when he begged us for mercy, but we didn’t listen. That’s why this distress has come to us.” 
42:22 Reuben answered them and said, “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t sin against the boy’? But you didn’t listen. Now, see how his blood is now being accounted for.” 
42:23 They did not know that Joseph was listening, since there was an interpreter between them. 
42:24 He turned away from them and wept. When he turned back to them and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and tied him up before their eyes. 
42:25 Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to return each man’s money to his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. So it was done for them. 
42:26 Then they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left from there. 
42:27 As one of them opened his sack to give fodder to his donkey at the lodge, he saw his money—behold, it was in the opening of his bag. 
42:28 So he said to his brothers, “My money has been returned! Look, it’s in my bag.” Their hearts sank. Trembling, each one turned to his brother and said, “What is this that God has done to us?” 
42:29 When they came to their father Jacob, in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying, 
42:30 “The man, the lord of the land, spoke with us harshly, and took us as spies of the land. 
42:31 But we said to him, ‘We’re honest. We’ve never been spies. 
42:32 We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is no more and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Canaan.’ 
42:33 Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I’ll know if you’re honest: leave one of your brothers with me. As for the hunger of your homes: take and go! 
42:34 Then bring your youngest brother to me, so that I may know you are not spies, but you are honest. I’ll give you back your brother and you can move about freely in the land.’” 
42:35 Now as they were emptying their sacks, behold, there was each man’s bundle of money in his sack. When they saw their money bundles, they and their father, they were afraid. 
42:36 Then their father Jacob said to them, “You’ve made me childless! Joseph is no more. Now Simeon is gone, and next you’ll take Benjamin! Everything is against me!” 
42:37 Then Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “You can put my two sons to death if I don’t bring him back to you. Put him in my hand and I—I will return him to you.” 
42:38  in grief.”
43:1 Now the famine was severe in the land. 
43:2 When they finished eating the grain they had brought from Egypt their father said to them, “Go back. Buy us a little food.” 
43:3 But Judah said to him, “The man warned us firmly saying, ‘You won’t see my face unless your brother is with you.’ 
43:4 If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy grain for you for food. 
43:5 But if you won’t send him, we won’t go down, because the man said to us, ‘You won’t see my face unless your brother is with you.’” 
43:6 Then Israel said, “Why did you do evil to me by telling the man that you have another brother?” 
43:7 They said, “The man questioned particularly about us and about our relatives saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have a brother?’ So we spoke to him on the basis of these words. How could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’”? 
43:8 Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Please, send the boy with me and we’ll get up and go, so that we’ll live and not die—we and you, and our children. 
43:9 I myself will be his pledge. You can demand him back from my own hand. If I don’t bring him back to you and place him before you, then you can blame me all my days. 
43:10 If we had not delayed, we could have returned twice by now.” 
43:11 Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: take some of the best products of the land in your bags, and bring an offering down to the man—a little balsam and a little honey, gum and myrrh, pistachios and almonds. 
43:12 Also take in your hand a double portion of silver, and bring back in your hand the silver that had been returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake. 
43:13 Take your brother too—now, get up, go back to the man! 
43:14  grant you mercy before the man, so that he may release your other brother to you, along with Benjamin. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.”
43:15 Then the men took this offering. They also took the double portion of silver in their hand, as well as Benjamin. So they got up and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. 
43:16 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the one over his house, “Bring the men into the house. Slaughter an animal and prepare it, for the men will eat with me this afternoon. 
43:17 So the man did as Joseph said, and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house. 
43:18 But the men were afraid, because they had been brought into Joseph’s house. They said, “It’s because of the silver that was returned to our sacks the first time that we are being brought in—to pounce on us and fall on us and take us as slaves, along with our donkeys.” 
43:19 So they approached the man who was over Joseph’s house and spoke to him at the entrance of the house. 
43:20 “I beg your pardon, my lord!” they said. “We indeed came down on the previous occasion to buy grain for food. 
43:21 When we came to the lodge and opened our sacks, behold, there was each man’s money at the opening of the sack, the full amount of our money. So we’ve returned it in our hand. 
43:22 Moreover, we’ve brought down other money in our hand to buy grain for food. We didn’t know who put our money into our sacks.” 
43:23 “Be at peace,” he replied. “Don’t be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks. Your money had come to me.” Then he brought Simeon out to them, 
43:24 and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, gave them water and they washed their feet. He also provided fodder for their donkeys. 
43:25 So they prepared the offering for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they had heard that they were going to eat there. 
43:26 When Joseph came home, they brought him the offering in their hand into the house, and they bowed down to the ground to him. 
43:27 Then he asked if they were well, and said, “Is he well—your elderly father that you told me about? Is he still alive?” 
43:28 “Your servant, our father, is well,” they said. “He’s still alive.” Then they knelt and bowed down. 
43:29 Then he lifted his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother whom you mentioned to me?” Then he said, “May God be gracious to you, my son.” 
43:30 Then Joseph hurried out because his compassion grew warm and tender toward his brother so that he wanted to cry. So he went into an inner room and wept there. 
43:31 Then he washed his face, came out, and controlled himself. “Serve the food,” he said. 
43:32 So they served him by himself, them by themselves, and the Egyptians who were eating with him by themselves (for Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews because it was an abomination to Egyptians). 
43:33 They were seated before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth. The men looked at each other in astonishment. 
43:34 Then portions were brought to them from before him—and Benjamin’s portion was five times larger than any of their portions. Yet they drank and made merry with him.
44:1 Then he commanded the one over his household saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with as much food as they are able to carry and put money in the opening of each man’s sack. 
44:2 Put my cup, the silver cup, in the opening of the sack of the youngest along with his grain money.” So he did as Joseph told him. 
44:3 When the morning dawned, the men were sent off, they and their donkeys. 
44:4 They left the city and did not get far, when Joseph said to the one over his household, “Get up, go after the men. When you catch up to them, say to them, “Why have you repaid evil for good? 
44:5 Isn’t this the one from which my lord drinks? He even uses it especially to discern by divination. What you’ve done is evil!” 
44:6 So he caught up to them and spoke these words to them. 
44:7 They said to him, “Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing as this. 
44:8 Look, the money we found in the opening of our bags, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. So how could we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house? 
44:9 Whoever among your servants is found with it, let him die! And we, we’ll also be my lord’s slaves.” 
44:10 “Even now let it be according to your words,” he said. “The one with whom it is found shall be my slave. But the rest of you shall be innocent.” 
44:11 Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground and each man opened his sack. 
44:12 He searched them beginning with the eldest and finishing with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 
44:13 Then they tore their clothing, and each one loaded up his donkey and they returned to the city. 
44:14 When Judah and his brothers entered Joseph’s house, he was still there. They fell to the ground before him. 
44:15 “What’s this deed you’ve done?” Joseph said to them, “Didn’t you know that a man like me can discern by divination?” 
44:16 Then Judah said, “What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? How can we justify ourselves? God has exposed your servants’ guilt. We are now my lord’s slaves—both we as well as the one in whose hand the cup was found.” 
44:17 But he said, “Far be it from me to do this. The one in whose hand the cup was found—he will be my slave. But you, go up to your father in peace.” 
44:18 Then Judah approached him and said, “I beg your pardon, my lord. Please let your servant say a word in my lord’s ears, and don’t be angry with your servant, since you are like Pharaoh. 
44:19 My lord asked his servants saying, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’ 
44:20 So we said to my lord, ‘We have a father who is old, a child born to him of his old age is young. Now his brother is dead, so he is the only one of his mother’s children left, and his father loves him.’ 
44:21 Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so that I can look at him.’ 
44:22 But we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father. If he were to leave his father, he would die.’ 
44:23 Then you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you won’t see my face again.’ 
44:24 “Now when we went up to your servant, my father, we told him my lord’s words. 
44:25 Then our father said, ‘Go back, buy us a little grain for food.’ 
44:26 So we said, ‘We won’t go down unless we have our youngest brother with us—then we’ll go down. For we won’t see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’ 
44:27 “Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You yourselves know that my wife bore me two sons. 
44:28 One went out from me, so I said, “He must have been torn to shreds,” and I haven’t seen him since. 
44:29 .’ 
44:30 “Now if I come to your servant my father and the boy isn’t with us, since his life is bound to his life, 
44:31  in grief. 
44:32 For your servant became pledge for the boy with my father saying, ‘If I don’t bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before my father all my days.’ 
44:33 So now, please let your servant remain as my lord’s slave in the boy’s place, and let the boy go up with his brothers. 
44:34 For how can I go up to my father and the boy is not with me? Else I must see the evil that would come upon my father!”
45:1 Now Joseph could no longer restrain himself in front of all those who were standing by him, so he cried out, “Get everyone away from me!” So no one stood with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers. 
45:2 But he gave his voice to weeping so that the Egyptians heard, and Pharaoh’s household heard. 
45:3 Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” And his brothers were unable to answer him because they were terrified at his presence. 
45:4 Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come near me.” So they came near. “I’m Joseph, your brother—the one you sold to Egypt,” he said. 
45:5 “So now, don’t be grieved and don’t be angry in your own eyes that you sold me here—since it was for preserving life that God sent me here before you. 
45:6 For there has been two years of famine in the land, and there will be five more years yet with no plowing or harvesting. 
45:7 But God sent me ahead of you to ensure a remnant in the land and to keep you alive for a great escape. 
45:8 So now, it wasn’t you, you didn’t send me here, but God! And He made me as a father to Pharaoh, lord over his whole house and ruler over the entire land of Egypt. 
45:9 “Go up quickly to my father and say to him, ‘Thus says your son, Joseph: God has made me lord over all Egypt. Come down to me. Don’t delay. 
45:10 Then you’ll live in the land of Goshen, and be close to me, you and your children and your children’s children, your flocks and your cattle, and everything that belongs to you. 
45:11 I’ll provide food for you there—for the famine will last another five years—otherwise you’ll lose everything, you and your household, and everything that belongs to you.’ 
45:12 And look, you and my brother Benjamin can see with your own eyes that it’s my mouth that’s speaking to you. 
45:13 You must tell my father about all my honor in Egypt, and about all that you’ve seen. And you must quickly bring my father down here.” 
45:14 Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept while Benjamin wept upon his neck, 
45:15 and he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. Finally after this, his brothers talked with him. 
45:16 When the commotion was heard in Pharaoh’s house—“Joseph’s brothers have come!”—it was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and his servants, 
45:17 So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers: ‘Do this! Load your animals and go to the land of Canaan. 
45:18 Then get your father, your households, and come to me. I’ll give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.’ 
45:19 You are also commanded to say: “Do this! Take for yourselves wagons from the land of Egypt for your little children and for your wives, and pick up your father and come. 
45:20 Don’t be concerned about your goods, because the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’” 
45:21 So the sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them carts by Pharaoh’s command and he gave them provisions for the journey. 
45:22 To each of them he gave a change of clothes, while to Benjamin he gave 300 pieces of silver and five sets of clothes. 
45:23 Also to his father he sent the following: ten donkeys carrying from the best of Egypt, and ten female donkeys carrying grain and food and provisions for his father’s journey. 
45:24 Then he sent his brothers off, and as they departed, he said to them, “Don’t be anxious on the way.” 
45:25 Then they went up from Egypt and came to the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father. 
45:26 They told him saying, “Joseph is still alive and he is ruler of the whole land of Egypt!” His heart went numb, for he did not believe them. 
45:27 But they told him all of Joseph’s words that he had told them. When he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to pick him up, the spirit of their father Jacob revived. 
45:28 Then Israel said, “Enough! My son Joseph is still alive. I must go and see him, before I die.”
46:1 So Israel set out, along with everything that belonged to him. When he came to Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 
46:2 ,” he said. 
46:3 “I am God, the God of your father,” He said. “Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will turn you into a great nation there. 
46:4 I Myself will go down with you to Egypt and I Myself will also most certainly bring you up. Joseph will put his hands on your eyes.” 
46:5 Then Jacob arose from Beersheba and Israel’s sons carried Jacob their father, their little children, and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 
46:6 They also took their livestock and their possessions they had acquired in the land of Canaan and they came to Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him. 
46:7 His sons and his grandsons with him, his daughters and his granddaughters, and all his offspring, he brought with him to Egypt. 
46:8 Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Jacob’s firstborn, Reuben, 
46:9 and Reuben’s sons: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. 
46:10 Simeon’s sons: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zochar and Shaul the son of the Canaanite woman. 
46:11 Levi’s sons: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. 
46:12 Judah’s sons: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez and Zerah. Er died along with Onan in the land of Canaan. Perez’s sons were Hezron and Hamul. 
46:13 Issachar’s sons: Tola, Puvah, Iob and Shimron. 
46:14 Zebulun’s sons: Sered, Elon and Jahleel. 
46:15 These are Leah’s sons whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, along with his daughter Dinah. The tally of all of his sons and daughters was 33 people. 
46:16 Gad’s sons: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi and Areli. 
46:17 Asher’s sons: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their sister. Beriah’s sons: Heber and Malchiel. 
46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter. She bore these to Jacob: 16 people. 
46:19 The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 
46:20 Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt—Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of On bore them to him. 
46:21 Benjamin’s sons: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim and Ard. 
46:22 These are Rachel’s sons who were born to Jacob. The tally of all the people was 14. 
46:23 The sons of Dan: Hushim 
46:24 Naphtali’s sons: Yachzeel, Guni, Yezer and Shillem. 
46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter and she bore these to Jacob. The tally of all the people was seven. 
46:26 All the people belonging to Jacob who came to Egypt—those coming from his loins (not counting the wives of Jacob’s sons)—the tally of all the people was 66. 
46:27 The sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt was a tally of two people. The tally of all the people belonging to Jacob’s house who came to Egypt was 70. 
46:28 Now he sent Judah before him to Joseph to show him the way to Goshen. When they came to the land of Goshen, 
46:29 Joseph harnessed his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel. As soon as he appeared before him, he fell upon his neck, and wept on his neck for some time. 
46:30 Then Israel said to Joseph, “At this time I am ready to die, after seeing your face in person—for you’re still alive!” 
46:31 Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I’ll go up and tell Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household who were in the land of Canaan have come to me. 
46:32 The men are shepherds, for they’ve been men who handle livestock, who have brought their flocks and cattle and everything that they possess.’ 
46:33 So when Pharaoh calls you and says, ‘What is your occupation?’ 
46:34 you must say, ‘Your servants have been men who handle livestock since the time of our youth until now, both we and our fathers,’ so that you can live in the land of Goshen, because every shepherd is loathsome to the Egyptians.”
47:1 Then Joseph came and informed Pharaoh, “My father and my brothers and their flocks and their cattle and everything that belongs to them have come from the land of Canaan, and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.” 
47:2 From among his brothers he took five men and presented them before Pharaoh. 
47:3 Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” So they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers.” 
47:4 Then they said to Pharaoh, “We came to dwell temporarily in the land, since there is no pasture for the flocks that belong to your servants, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. So now, please let your servants live in the land of Goshen.” 
47:5 Pharaoh said to Joseph saying, “Your father and your brothers came to you. 
47:6 The land of Egypt is before you—settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land. Let them live in the land of Goshen. If you know of any capable men among them, make them overseers of the livestock—over those that are mine.” 
47:7 Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
47:8  Pharaoh asked Jacob, “How many days are the years of your life?” 
47:9 Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my sojourn are 130 years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life. Moreover, the days of the years of my life have not attained the days of the years of the lives of my fathers, in the days of their sojourn.” 
47:10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from Pharaoh’s presence. 
47:11 Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them property in the land of Egypt, in the best part of the land, in the land of Rameses, just as Pharaoh commanded. 
47:12 And Joseph supported his father and his brothers and his father’s entire household with food for the mouths of the little ones. 
47:13 Now there was no food in all the land because the famine was very severe. Both the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine. 
47:14 Joseph collected all the money that could be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain that they bought, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house. 
47:15 Then the money of the land of Egypt and of the land of Canaan ran out and all of Egypt came to Joseph saying, “Give us food. Why should we die in front of you because the money is gone?” 
47:16 Joseph said, “Give your livestock and I’ll give it to you for your livestock, if the money is gone.” 
47:17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph and Joseph gave them food in exchange for horses, for flocks of sheep, for herds of cattle and for donkeys. He provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year. 
47:18 When that year came to an end, they came to him in the second year and said to him, “We won’t hide from my lord that the money has run out and the livestock and the domestic animals are my lord’s. There is nothing left in my lord’s sight except our bodies and our land. 
47:19 Why should we die before your eyes—both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food—we and our land will become Pharaoh’s slaves. Provide seed so that we may live and not die, and the land won’t be deserted.” 
47:20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh because the Egyptians, each one, sold his field, for the famine overcame them. Thus the land became Pharaoh’s. 
47:21 He made the people slaves from one end of Egypt’s border to the other. 
47:22 Only he did not buy the land belonging to the priests, because the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they ate their allotment that Pharaoh gave them. Therefore they did not sell their land. 
47:23 Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you, so that you can sow the land. 
47:24 During the harvest you must give a fifth part to Pharaoh and four-fifths will be for you, for seed for the field and for your food, and for those in your houses, and for food for your little ones.” 
47:25 “You’ve saved our lives,” they said. “We find favor in the eyes of my lord, and we’ll be Pharaoh’s slaves.” 
47:26 So Joseph set it as a statute until this very day concerning the land of Egypt: a fifth-part goes to Pharaoh. Only the priests’ land did not become Pharaoh’s. 
47:27 Meanwhile, Israel settled in the land of Egypt in the land of Goshen, acquired property in it, and were fruitful and multiplied greatly.
47:28 Now Jacob lived in the land of Egypt for 17 years, so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were 147 years. 
47:29 As the time of Israel’s death drew near, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please put your hand under my thigh and show me faithful kindness. Please do not bury me in Egypt. 
47:30 When I lie down with my fathers, you must carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place.” So he said, “I myself will do according to your word.” 
47:31 “Swear to me,” he said. So he swore to him. Then Israel bowed down in worship on the head of his staff.
48:1 After these things, someone told Joseph, “Behold, your father is sick.” So he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, with him. 
48:2 When someone told Jacob, saying, “Behold, your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel summoned his strength and sat up in the bed. 
48:3  appeared to me in Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blessed me.” 
48:4 He said to me, ‘I am going to make you fruitful and multiply you and turn you into an assembly of peoples, and I will give this land to your seed after you as an everlasting possession.’ 
48:5 So now, your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, they are mine. Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just like Reuben and Simeon. 
48:6 Any descendent of yours whom you father after them will be yours; they will be identified by the names of their brothers for their inheritance. 
48:7 “Now as for me, when I came from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died along the way, in the land of Canaan, while we were still a distance from entering Ephrath. And I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).” 
48:8 Then Israel saw Joseph’s sons and said, “Who are these?” 
48:9 Joseph said to his father, “They’re my sons, whom God has given me here.” Then he said, “Please bring them to me, so I may bless them.” 
48:10 Now Israel’s eyes had grown heavy with old age—he could not see. So he brought them near to him, and he kissed them and hugged them. 
48:11 Then Israel said to Joseph, “To see your face, I didn’t expect—and look, God has let me see your offspring as well!” 
48:12 Then Joseph took them from his knees and bowed with his face down to the ground. 
48:13 Then Joseph took the two of them—Ephraim with his right hand across from Israel’s left, and Manasseh with his left hand across from Israel’s right—and brought them close to him. 
48:14 But Israel stretched out his right hand and placed it upon Ephraim’s head (though he was the younger), and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, crossing his hands (though Manasseh was the firstborn). 
48:15 Then he blessed Joseph and said, “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, The God who has shepherded me throughout my life to this day, 
48:16 The Angel who redeemed me from all evil, May He bless the boys, and may they be called by my name, and by the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac. May they multiply to a multitude in the midst of the land.” 
48:17 When Joseph saw that his father placed his right hand upon Ephraim’s head, it was wrong in his eyes. So his took hold of his father’s hand to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. 
48:18 Joseph said to his father, “Not like that, my father, because this one’s the firstborn. Put your right hand upon his head.” 
48:19 But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will become great. But his younger brother will become greater than he and his seed will be the fullness of the nations.” 
48:20 Then he blessed them that day saying, “In you shall Israel bless by saying: ‘May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.’” Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh. 
48:21 Then Israel said to Joseph, “Look, I am about to die. But God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your fathers. 
48:22 Now I myself give you one portion more than your brothers, that which I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and my bow.”
49:1 Jacob called his sons and said to them: Gather together so that I can tell you what will happen to you in the last days. 
49:2 Be assembled and listen, sons of Jacob, and listen to Israel your father. 
49:3 Reuben, my firstborn are you, my vigor and firstborn of my power, endowed with extra dignity, endowed with extra strength— 
49:4 like water boiling over you will not have extra, for you got up into your father’s bed, when you defiled a maid’s couch. 
49:5 Simeon and Levi are brothers, instruments of violence are their knives. 
49:6 In their secret counsel may my soul not enter. In their contingent may my honor never be united. For in their anger they slew men, and in their self-will they maimed oxen. 
49:7 Cursed be their anger for it was strong and their rage for it was cruel— I will disperse them in Jacob, I will scatter them in Israel. 
49:8 Judah, so you are— your brothers will praise you: Your hand will be on your enemies’ neck. Your father’s sons will bow down to you. 
49:9 A lion’s cub is Judah— from the prey, my son, you have gone up. He crouches, lies down like a lion, or like a lioness— who would rouse him? 
49:10 The scepter will not pass from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until he to whom it belongs will come. To him will be the obedience of the peoples. 
49:11 Binding his foal to the vine, his donkey’s colt to the choice vine, he washes his garments in wine, and in the blood of grapes his robe. 
49:12 His eyes are darker than wine, and teeth that are whiter than milk. 
49:13 Zebulun will dwell by the seashore, and be by a harbor for ships— his distant border reaches Sidon. 
49:14 Issachar is a strong-boned donkey, lying down between two saddlebags. 
49:15 He saw that a resting place was good, and that the land was pleasant. He leaned his shoulder to bear a burden, and became a forced laborer. 
49:16 Dan will judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. 
49:17 Let Dan be a serpent beside a road, a viper beside a path, who strikes a horse’s heels, so that its rider falls backward. 
49:18 ! 
49:19 Gad—attackers will attack him, but he will attack their heels. 
49:20 Asher—rich is his food— he will provide delicacies fit for a king. 
49:21 Naphtali is a doe let loose, who offers words of beauty. 
49:22 A fruitful son is Joseph, a fruitful son beside a spring— daughters walk along a wall. 
49:23 The archers were bitter and shot arrows and were hostile towards him. 
49:24 Yet his bow was always filled, and his arms quick-moving— by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob. From there a Shepherd, the Stone of Israel, 
49:25  who blesses you, with blessings of heavens above, blessings of the deep that lies below, blessings of breasts and womb. 
49:26 The blessings of your father surpassed the blessings of the ancient mountains, the desire of the everlasting hills. May they be upon Joseph’s head, upon the crown of the one set apart from his brothers. 
49:27 Benjamin is a ravening wolf— in the morning he devours spoils, and in the evening divides plunder. 
49:28 These are the tribes of Israel, twelve in all, and this is what their father spoke to them. He blessed them, each one he blessed with a suitable blessing. 
49:29 Then he charged them and said to them, “I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
49:30 in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, that is next to Mamre in the land of Canaan—the field that Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite as a property for burial. 
49:31 There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah, and there I buried Leah. 
49:32 The field was purchased along with the cave in it from the sons of Het.” 
49:33 When Jacob finished commanding his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, then breathed his last and was gathered to his peoples.
50:1 Joseph fell upon his father’s face, wept over him and kissed him. 
50:2 Then Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father, so the physicians embalmed Israel. 
50:3 They took 40 days for him, because that is how long embalming takes, and Egypt wept 70 days. 
50:4 When the days of formal weeping passed, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh’s house saying, “If I’ve found favor in your eyes, please say in Pharaoh’s ears, 
50:5 “My father made me take an oath saying, ‘Behold, I am about to die. In my tomb—which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan—there you must bury me.’ So now, please allow me to go up and bury my father, and then return.” 
50:6 Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father just as he made you swear on oath.” 
50:7 So Joseph went up to bury his father. Also all of Pharaoh’s servants, the elders of his household and all the elders of the land of Egypt went up with him, 
50:8 along with all of Joseph’s house, his brothers, and his father’s household. Only their children and their flocks and cattle were left in the land of Goshen. 
50:9 Chariots and horsemen also went up with him—it was a very impressive company. 
50:10 When they came to the threshing floor of the bramble on the other side of the Jordan, they mourned there—a very great and solemn lamentation. He observed seven days of mourning for his father. 
50:11 When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning ritual at the threshing floor of the prickly bush, they said, “A solemn mourning ritual this is for the Egyptians.” That is why it is named Abel-Mizraim, which is on the other side of the Jordan. 
50:12 So Jacob’s sons did for him just as he commanded them. 
50:13 His sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, the field that Abraham bought as a property for burial from Ephron the Hittite, next to Mamre. 
50:14 After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all those who went up with him to bury his father.
50:15 When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father had died, they said, “Maybe Joseph will be hostile towards us and pay us back in full for all the evil we showed him. 
50:16 So they charged Joseph saying, “Before his death, your father gave a command, saying, 
50:17 “Thus you must say to Joseph: ‘Please forgive, I beg you, the transgression of your brothers and their sin because they treated you wrongly.’ Therefore, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” Then Joseph wept when they spoke to him, 
50:18 and his brothers also came and fell down before him and said, “Behold, we are your slaves!” 
50:19 But Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid. For am I in the place of God? 
50:20 Yes, you yourselves planned evil against me. God planned it for good, in order to bring about what it is this day—to preserve the lives of many people. 
50:21 So now, don’t be afraid. I myself will provide food for you and your little ones.” So he reassured them, speaking kindly to them. 
50:22 Joseph remained in Egypt—he and his father’s household—and Joseph lived 110 years. 
50:23 Joseph saw the third generation of Ephraim’s sons. Also the sons of Machir, Manasseh’s son, were born upon Joseph’s knees. 
50:24 Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I’m about to die. But God will surely take notice of you and will bring you up from this land to the land that He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” 
50:25 Then Joseph made Israel’s sons swear an oath saying, “When God takes notice of you, you will bring my bones up from here.” 
50:26 So Joseph died at 110 years old, and they embalmed him and he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
