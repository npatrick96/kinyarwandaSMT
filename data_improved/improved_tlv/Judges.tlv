1:1 Now it came to pass after the death of Joshua that </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
1:2  said, “Judah will go up. Behold, I have given the land into his hand.” 
1:3 Judah then said to his brother Simeon, “Come up with me to my allotted territory, so that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I also will go with you into your allotted territory.” So Simeon went with him. 
1:4 When Judah went up, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:5 They found Adoni-bezek in Bezek, engaged him in battle, and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 
1:6 Though Adoni-bezek fled, they pursued him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. 
1:7 So Adoni-bezek said, “70 kings, having their thumbs and big toes cut off, used to pick up scraps under my table. As I have done, so God has repaid me.” They brought him to Jerusalem and he died there. 
1:8 Then the children of Judah attacked Jerusalem, captured it, struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire. 
1:9 Afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt in the hill country, in the Negev and in the lowland. 
1:10 Judah then marched against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron (the former name of Hebron was Kiriath-arba), and they defeated Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. 
1:11 From there Judah marched against the inhabitants of Debir (the former name of Debir was Kiriath-sepher). 
1:12 Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, to him will I give my daughter Achsah for a wife.” 
1:13 So Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger kinsman, captured it. So Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife. 
1:14 Now it came about when she came to him, she had persuaded Othniel to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you need?” 
1:15 Give me a blessing,” she said. “For you have given me land in the Negev; you should also give me springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the Upper Springs and the Lower Springs. 
1:16 The children of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up with the children of Judah from the City of Palms to the wilderness of Judah, which is in the Negev of Arad. They went and settled with the people. 
1:17 Then Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they defeated the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath. They utterly destroyed it, and thus the name of the city was called Hormah. 
1:18 Also Judah captured Gaza with its territory, Ashkelon with its territory and Ekron with its territory. 
1:19  was with Judah, and he possessed the hill country, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had iron chariots. 
1:20 Then they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had promised, so he drove out from there the three sons of Anak. 
1:21 But the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem, so the Jebusites continued to live with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day. 
1:22 Also the house of Joseph marched against Bethel, and </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:23 The house of Joseph sent men to spy out Bethel (the former name of the city was Luz). 
1:24 Now the scouts saw a man coming out from the city and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance into the city and we will deal kindly with you.” 
1:25 So he showed them the entrance into the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man go free with all his family. 
1:26 So the man went into the land of the Hittites, built a city, and named it Luz, which is its name to this day. 
1:27 Manasseh, however, did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages. So the Canaanites resolved to dwell in that land. 
1:28 When Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out. 
1:29 Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who were living in Gezer, so the Canaanites settled in Gezer among them. 
1:30 Nor did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol, so the Canaanites settled among them, but became subject to forced labor. 
1:31 Nor did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Zidon, Achlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik or Rehob; 
1:32 so the Asherites lived among the Canaanites who were dwelling in the land, because they did not drive them out. 
1:33 Nor did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but lived among the Canaanites dwelling in the land, though the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath became forced labor for them. 
1:34 But the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country, for they would not let them come down to the valley. 
1:35 Also the Amorites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heres, in Aijalon and in Shaalbim, but when the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, they became forced labor for them. 
1:36 So the territory of the Amorites ran from the Ascent of Akrabbim from the Rock and upward.
2:1 Now the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:2 Now as for you, you must make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land. You must break down their altars.’ But you have not listened to My voice. What is this you have done? 
2:3 Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out from before you, but they will be thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.’” 
2:4 Now when the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:5 So they called the name of that place Bochim, and they sacrificed there to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:6 Now when Joshua had sent the people away, </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
2:7 Then the people worshipped </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:8 Then Joshua son of Nun, the servant of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:9 and they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash. 
2:10 But when all that generation were gathered to their fathers, there arose another generation after them that did not experience </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:11 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
2:12 They abandoned </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:13 So they forsook </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:14 So the anger of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:15 Whenever they went out, the hand of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:16 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:17 Yet they listened not to their judges, for they prostituted themselves after other gods and bowed down to them. They quickly turned aside from the way in which their fathers walked in obeying the commandments of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:18 Whenever </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:19 But when the judge died, they would keep turning back and acted more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods, worshipping them, and bowing down to them. They abandoned none of their practices and stubborn ways. 
2:20 So the anger of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:21 I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died, 
2:22 in order to test Israel by them, whether or not they will keep the way of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:23 So </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:1 Now these are the nations that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:2 It was only in order that the generations of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
3:3 These nations included the five Philistine lords, and all the Canaanites, Zidonians and the Hivites living in the hill country of Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath. 
3:4 They were for testing Israel, to know whether they would obey the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">mitzvot
3:5 But </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
3:6 and took their daughters for themselves as wives, gave their own daughters to their sons, and worshipped their gods. 
3:7  their God and worshipped the Baalim and the Asherahs.
3:8 So </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:9 When </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
3:10 The Spirit of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:11 Then the land had peace 40 years. When Othniel son of Kenaz died, 
3:12 ’s eyes. 
3:13 So he gathered to himself the people of Ammon and Amalek, then went and defeated Israel and took possession of the City of Palms. 
3:14  became subject to King Eglon of Moab for 18 years. 
3:15 But when </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
3:16 Ehud made himself a double-edged sword, a cubit in length, which he girded on his right thigh under his cloak. 
3:17 Then he presented the tribute to King Eglon of Moab. Eglon was a very fat man. 
3:18 Now when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he dismissed the people who had carried the tribute, 
3:19 but he himself turned back, at the idols that were near Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” “Keep silence!” he replied, so all his attendants left him. 
3:20 Then Ehud approached him while he was sitting alone in a roof chamber where it was cool, and said, “I have a message from God for you,” so he arose from his throne. 
3:21 Then Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh and thrust it into his belly. 
3:22 Even the handle went in after the blade and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not withdraw the sword out of his belly—and the filth came out. 
3:23 Then Ehud went out by the porch, shut the doors of the roof chamber on him, and locked them. 
3:24 After he had gone out, his courtiers came and looked, but behold, the doors of the roof chamber were locked. So they said, “He is only relieving himself in the cool chamber.” 
3:25 So they waited till they were embarrassed, but behold, he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber. So they took the key and opened them—and behold, their master was lying dead on the floor. 
3:26 But Ehud escaped while they were lingering, passed beyond the idols and escaped to Seirah. 
3:27 When he arrived, he blew the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shofar
3:28 He said to them, “Follow me, for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:29 Then they struck down at that time about 10,000 men of Moab—all stout men of valor—not a man escaped. 
3:30 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. Then the land had peace for 80 years. 
3:31 After him came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down 600 Philistine men with an ox-goad. So he also delivered Israel.
4:1 But </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
4:2 So </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:3 So </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
4:4 Now Deborah, a woman who was a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. 
4:5 She used to sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
4:6 Now she sent and summoned Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, “Hasn’t </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:7 Then at the Kishon torrent, I will draw out to you Sisera, commander of Jabin’s army with his chariots and his multitude, and I will give him into your hand.’” 
4:8 But Barak said to her, “If you are going with me, then I will go. But if you aren’t going with me, I won’t go.” 
4:9 “Surely I will go with you,” she said. “However, no honor will be yours on the way that you are about to go—for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:10 Then Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh, and 10,000 men marched up after him, and Deborah went up with him. 
4:11 Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh. 
4:12 They told Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor. 
4:13 So Sisera ordered all his chariots—900 iron chariots—and all the troops that were with him, from Harosheth-ha-goyim to the Kishon. 
4:14 Then Deborah said to Barak, “Arise! For this is the day in which </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:15  threw Sisera and all his chariots and all his army into confusion before Barak with the edge of the sword. Then Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot. 
4:16 But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth-ha-goyim. The whole army of Sisera fell by the sword; not one was left. 
4:17 Meanwhile Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Yael the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between King Jabin of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 
4:18 So Yael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me! Don’t be afraid!” So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a blanket. 
4:19 He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened a skin of milk and made him drink some, and covered him. 
4:20 Then he said to her, “Stand at the entrance of the tent, and if anyone comes and asks you saying, ‘Is there a man here?’ then you will say, ‘There’s no one.’” 
4:21 Then Yael, Heber’s wife, took a tent pin and got a hammer in her hand, approached him stealthily and drove the pin into his temple until it pierced through into the ground—for he was exhausted and in a deep sleep. So he died. 
4:22 Now behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Yael came out to meet him and said to him, “Come, I will show you the man whom you are seeking.” So he entered with her, and behold, Sisera was lying dead, with a tent-pin in his temple! 
4:23 So on that day God subdued King Jabin of Canaan before </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
4:24 The hand of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
5:1 Then Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang on that day saying: 
5:2 “When leaders take the lead in Israel, when people freely offer themselves, bless </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:3 Listen, O kings! Give ear, O rulers! I, to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:4 , when You came out from Seir, when You marched from Edom’s field, the earth trembled, the heavens also dropped, yes, the clouds dropped water. 
5:5 The mountains quaked before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:6 In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Yael, the highways were deserted, travelers walked by crooked paths. 
5:7  Villages were deserted in Israel, deserted, until I, Deborah, arose, a mother in Israel arose. 
5:8 They chose new gods— then war was in the gates. No shield or spear was seen among 40,000 in Israel! 
5:9 My heart is with Israel’s rulers, who offer themselves freely among the people. Bless </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:10 Riders on white donkeys, sitting on saddle blankets, traveling on the road, sing! 
5:11 Louder than the sound of archers, at the watering places! There let them rehearse the righteous acts of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:12 Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, utter a song! Arise, Barak, lead away your captives, O son of Abinoam! 
5:13 Then a remnant of nobles came down. </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:14 Those with root in Amalek are from Ephraim, following you, Benjamin, with your peoples. From Machir came down rulers, and from Zebulun wielding the marshal’s staff. 
5:15 Issachar’s chiefs were with Deborah. Issachar was with Barak. Into the valley they rushed at his heels. Among the divisions of Reuben there were great resolves of heart. 
5:16 Why did you stay in the sheepfolds— to hear the piping for the flocks? Among the clans of Reuben there was much searching of heart. 
5:17 Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan, and Dan, why did he stay by the ships? Asher sat at the seacoast, dwelling by its docks. 
5:18 Zebulun is a people who jeopardized their lives to death, and Naphtali also, on the heights of the battlefield. 
5:19 The kings came, they fought, then the kings of Canaan fought, at Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo, but they took no spoil of silver. 
5:20 From heaven, the stars fought, in their courses they fought Sisera. 
5:21 The Kishon torrent swept them away— that ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon! O my soul, march on with strength! 
5:22 Then the horses’ hooves beat from the dashing, the dashing of his mighty steeds. 
5:23 ‘Curse Meroz!’ said the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:24 Blessed above women is Yael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, above women in the tent is she blessed. 
5:25  Water he asked, milk she gave him. In a lordly bowl she brought him butter. 
5:26 Her hand reached for the tent pin, her right hand to the workmen’s hammer, and with the hammer she struck Sisera, she smashed his head— yes, she crushed and pierced his temple. 
5:27 At her feet he collapsed, he fell, he lay. Between her feet he bowed, he fell. Where he bowed, there he fell dead. 
5:28 Through the window, Sisera’s mother looked out, through the lattice. and lamented shrilly: ‘Why does his chariot delay in coming? Why do the wheels of his chariots tarry?’ 
5:29 The wisest of her princesses answer her, yes, she repeats the words to herself: 
5:30 ‘Are they not finding, dividing the spoil? A maiden, maidens for every warrior! To Sisera a spoil of dyed garments— a spoil of dyed garments of embroidery, double-dyed garments of embroidery for the necks of every spoiler!’ 
5:31 So let all Your enemies perish, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:1 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
6:2 Midian maintained an upper hand over Israel, and because of Midian </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
6:3 Whenever Israel had done their sowing, the Midianites, Amalekites and people from the east would come up and raid them. 
6:4 They would set up camp by them, destroy the produce of the land as far as Gaza, and leave nothing in Israel to live on—not a sheep, ox or donkey. 
6:5 For they would come up with their cattle and their tents, invade like a multitude of locusts. Both they and their camels were innumerable, and they would come to the land to ruin it. 
6:6 So Israel was brought very low because of Midian, and </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
6:7 Now it came about when </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
6:8 that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:9 Then I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all your oppressors, and drove them out from before you and gave you their land. 
6:10 Then I said to you, “I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:11 Then the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:12 Then the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:13 But Gideon said to him, “O my lord, if </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:14 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:15 Then he said to him, “Me, my Lord? With what would I deliver Israel? Look, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.” 
6:16 But </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:17 Then he said to Him, “If now I have found favor in Your eyes, then please, show me a sign that it is really You talking with me. 
6:18 Please, don’t leave from here, until I come to You and bring out my offering and lay it before You.” So He said, “I will stay until you come back.” 
6:19 Then Gideon went in and prepared a kid and </span><span class="it"><span class="content">matzot
6:20 Then the angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">matzah
6:21 Then the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:22 When Gideon realized that He was the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:23 But </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:24 So Gideon built an altar there to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:25 Now it came to pass the same night that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:26 build an altar to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:27 So Gideon took ten of his male servants and did as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:28 Now when the townspeople arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, the Asherah pole that was beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered up on the altar that was built. 
6:29 So they said one to another, “Who did this thing?” And when they inquired and asked around, they said: “Gideon son of Joash did this thing.” 
6:30 Then the townspeople said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal, and even cut down the Asherah pole that was beside it.” 
6:31 But Joash said to all who stood against him, “So you’re going to defend Baal? You’re going to rescue him? Whoever defends him will be put to death in the morning! If he is a god, let him defend himself—since someone has broken down his altar.” 
6:32 So on that day he was called Jerubbaal saying, “Let Baal contend with him, since he broke down his altar.” 
6:33 Now all the Midianites, the Amalekites and the people of the east gathered together, crossed over and camped in the valley of Jezreel. 
6:34 But the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
6:35 Then he sent messengers throughout Manasseh, and they also rallied behind him.Then he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, and they came up to join them.
6:36 Then Gideon said to God, “If You are going to deliver Israel by my hand, as You have spoken, 
6:37 see, I am putting a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor. If there is dew only on the fleece, and all the ground is dry, then I will know that You will deliver Israel by my hand, as You have spoken.” 
6:38 And it was so. When he rose up early next day, he squeezed the fleece and wrung dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water. 
6:39 Then Gideon said to God, “Let not Your anger burn against me if I speak once more. Let me please test once more with the fleece—let it now be dry only on the fleece, but let there be dew over all the ground.” 
6:40 God did so that night, since it was dry only on the fleece, and there was dew over all the ground.
7:1 Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him, rose up early and camped beside En-harod, while the camp of Midian was north of them, by Gibeath-moreh, in the valley. 
7:2 But </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:3 So now, make proclamation in the ears of the people saying, ‘Whoever is afraid or anxious may turn back and leave from Mount Gilead.’” So 22,000 people turned back, while ten thousand remained. 
7:4 But </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:5 So he brought the troops down to the water, and </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:6 Now the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was 300 men, but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water. 
7:7 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:8 So the 300 took provisions and their </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shofar
7:9 It came to pass the same night that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:10 But if you are afraid to go down, first go down to the camp with your attendant Purah. 
7:11 Then you will hear what they are saying, and after that your hands will be strengthened to attack the camp.” So he went down with his attendant Purah to an outpost of the army that was in camp. 
7:12 Now the Midianites, the Amalekites and all the people of the east were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were countless, as numerous as the sand on the seashore. 
7:13 Yet when Gideon came, behold, there was a man relating a dream to his fellow, saying, “Listen, I just now had a dream: there was a loaf of barley bread that came tumbling into the camp of Midian, came up to a tent and struck it so it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.” 
7:14 His companion answered and said, “This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel—God has delivered Midian and all the camp into his hand!” 
7:15 Now when Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship. Then he returned to the camp of Israel and said, “Arise! For </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:16 Then he divided the 300 men into three columns, and he put into the hands of all of them </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shofar
7:17 Then he said to them, “Watch me and do likewise. So behold, when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do just as I do. 
7:18 When I and all that are with me blow the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shofar
7:19 So Gideon and the 300 men who were with him came up to the outermost part of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just posted the watch. Then they blew the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shofar
7:20 When the three columns blew the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shofar
7:21 Each one stood in his place around the camp, and then the entire army ran, shouting as they fled. 
7:22 Now when they blew the 300 </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shofar
7:23 Then men of Israel were summoned from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian. 
7:24 Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim saying, “Come down against Midian and seize the waters down to Beth-barah, all along the Jordan.” So all the men of Ephraim were summoned and took control of the waterside as far as Beth-barah by the Jordan. 
7:25 Then they captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; they slew Oreb at the Rock of Oreb and they slew Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb. They kept pursuing Midian, and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon from across the Jordan. 
8:1 Now the men of Ephraim said to him, “What is this thing you have done to us, not calling us when you went to fight against Midian?” So they criticized him sharply. 
8:2 But he said to them, “What have I now done compared to you? Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? 
8:3 God has given into your hand the princes of Midian—Oreb and Zeeb—so what was I able to do compared to you?” Their anger with him subsided after he said this. 
8:4 Then Gideon reached the Jordan and crossed over. He and the 300 men with him were exhausted, yet still pursuing. 
8:5 He said to the men of Succoth, “Please, give loaves of bread to the people on foot with me, for they are exhausted, and I am chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.” 
8:6 But the officials of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand? So why we should give bread to your army?” 
8:7 Gideon replied, “Therefore when </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:8 From there he went up to Penuel and spoke to them similarly, but the men of Penuel answered him just as the men of Succoth had answered. 
8:9 So he spoke also to the men of Penuel saying, “When I come back safely, I will tear down this tower.” 
8:10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and with them their armies of about 15,000 men, all who were left of all the army of the people of the east—the fallen were 120,000 swordsmen. 
8:11 Now Gideon went up by the road of the tent dwellers on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and ambushed the camp when it was off guard. 
8:12 When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the whole army. 
8:13 Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle by the Ascent of Heres. 
8:14 He captured a boy from the people of Succoth and questioned him, so he wrote down for him the officials of Succoth and its elders—77 men. 
8:15 When he came to the men of Succoth, he said, “Behold Zebah and Zalmunna—about whom you mocked me saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand? Why should we give bread to your exhausted men?’” 
8:16 Then he seized the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he punished the men of Succoth. 
8:17 He also tore down the tower of Penuel and slew the men of the city. 
8:18 Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?” “As you are, so they were,” they answered. “Each one looked like the children of a king.” 
8:19 “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother,” he said. “As </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:20 Then he said to Jeter his first-born, “Arise, kill them!” But the boy could not draw his sword, for he was afraid, since he was still a youth. 
8:21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise up yourself and fall on us—for as the man is, so is his strength.” So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments that were on their camels’ necks. 
8:22 Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us—you, your son, and your grandson as well. For you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.” 
8:23 But Gideon replied to them, “I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:24 Yet Gideon said to them, “I would make a request of you, that you would give me every man an earring from his spoil.” (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) 
8:25 “We’ll certainly give them!” they replied. So they spread out a robe, and each one of them threw an earring from his spoil. 
8:26 So the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels of gold—besides the crescent ornaments, the pendants and the purple robes that were on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were on their camels’ necks. 
8:27 Gideon made it into an ephod, and put it in his town Ophrah. But all Israel prostituted themselves after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his household. 
8:28 So Midian was subdued before </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
8:29 Jerubbaal son of Joash went and lived in his own house. 
8:30 Now Gideon had 70 sons of his own issue, for he had many wives. 
8:31 Also his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son—he called his name Abimelech. 
8:32 Then Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. 
8:33 But it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
8:34 So </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
8:35 Nor did they show kindness to the household of Jerubbaal, namely Gideon, in accord with all the goodness which he had done for Israel.
9:1 Now Abimelech son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem, to his mother’s brothers, and spoke to them and the whole clan of his mother’s father’s household saying, 
9:2 “Speak now, in the ears of all the leaders of Shechem: Which is better for you, that 70 men—all the sons of Jerubbaal—rule over you, or that a single man rules over you? Remember also that I am your flesh and bone.” 
9:3 When his mother’s brothers discussed all these words of his in the ears of all Shechem’s leaders, their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our brother.” 
9:4 So they gave him 70 pieces of silver from the temple of Baal-berith. Abimelech then hired idle and reckless fellows, who followed him. 
9:5 Then he went to his father’s house at Ophrah and slew his brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal, 70 men, on top of one stone. But Jotam, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived, for he hid himself. 
9:6 Then all the leaders of Shechem and all Beth-millo assembled themselves together and went and made Abimelech king at the terebinth of the pillar that was in Shechem. 
9:7 Now when they told Jotam, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, lifted up his voice, called out and said to them, “Listen to me, O lords of Shechem, that God may listen to you! 
9:8 Once the trees set out to anoint a king over them. So they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us.’ 
9:9 But the olive tree said to them, ‘Should I stop yielding my oil, that honors God and man, and go wave over the trees?’ 
9:10 Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and reign over us.’ 
9:11 But the fig tree said to them, ‘Should I stop yielding my sweetness and my delicious fruit, and go wave over the trees?’ 
9:12 So the trees said to the vine, ‘You come and reign over us.’ 
9:13 But the vine said to them, ‘Should I stop yielding my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go wave over the trees?’ 
9:14 Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘You come and reign over us.’ 
9:15 And the bramble said to the trees, ‘If you truly are going to anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shadow; but if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’ 
9:16 “So now, if you have acted in truth and integrity by making Abimelech king, and if you have dealt kindly with Jerubbaal and his household, and have done for him as he deserved—
9:17 for my father fought for you, and risked his life and delivered you from the hand of Midian, 
9:18 but you have risen up against my father’s household today and have slain his sons—70 men on one stone—and have made Abimelech, son of his maidservant, king over the lords of Shechem just because he is your brother—
9:19 if you then have dealt in truth and integrity with Jerubbaal and with his household today, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you. 
9:20 But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the lords of Shechem and Beth-millo, and let fire come out from the lords of Shechem and from Beth-millo and devour Abimelech!” 
9:21 Then Jotam ran away and fled, and went to Beer and remained there because of his brother Abimelech. 
9:22 After Abimelech had ruled over Israel for three years, 
9:23 God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the lords of Shechem. So the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech—
9:24 in order that the violence done to Jerubbaal’s 70 sons might come due, so their blood might be laid on their brother Abimelech who slew them, and on the lords of Shechem who strengthened his hands to slay his brothers. 
9:25 So the lords of Shechem set up ambushers on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed anyone who passed by them along that road. So it was reported to Abimelech. 
9:26 Now Gaal son of Ebed had come with his relatives and moved to Shechem, and the lords of Shechem put their trust in him. 
9:27 When they went out into the field, they gathered grapes of their vineyards, trod them and had a party. Then they went into the house of their god, ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech. 
9:28 Then Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Isn’t he the son of Jerubbaal? Isn’t Zebul his deputy? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem—but why should we serve him? 
9:29 Now, if this people were under my hand, then I would get rid of Abimelech.” So he said to Abimelech, “Muster your army and come out!” 
9:30 When Zebul the governor of the city heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, his anger burned. 
9:31 So he sent messengers to Abimelech in deceit saying, “Watch out, Gaal son of Ebed and his relatives have moved to Shechem, and look, they are inciting the city against you. 
9:32 So now, arise by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field. 
9:33 So it will be in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you will rise early and advance on the city; and behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, then you should do to them whatever your hand finds.” 
9:34 So Abimelech and all the people who were with him rose up by night and lay in wait against Shechem in four columns. 
9:35 Now Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate. Then Abimelech and the people who were with him emerged from the ambush. 
9:36 When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!” But Zebul said to him, “You’re seeing the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.” 
9:37 Then Gaal spoke up again and said, “Look, people are coming down from the middle of the land, and one column is coming by the road of the Diviner’s Oak.” 
9:38 Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your mouth now? With it you said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ Isn’t this the people that you have trashed? Now go out and fight him!” 
9:39 So Gaal went out ahead of the lords of Shechem and fought with Abimelech. 
9:40 But Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many fell wounded up to the entrance of the gate. 
9:41 While Abimelech stayed in Arumah, Zebul drove Gaal and his relatives out so that they could not stay in Shechem. 
9:42 Now it came to pass the next day that the people went out into the field, and it was reported to Abimelech. 
9:43 So he took his people, divided them into three columns, and lay in ambush in the field. When he looked and saw the people were coming out of the city, he pounced on them and struck them down. 
9:44 Then Abimelech and the column that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the city gate, and the other two columns rushed on all who were in the open field and struck them down. 
9:45 So Abimelech fought against the city all that day, captured the city and killed the people that were in it. Then he razed the city and sowed it with salt. 
9:46 Now when all the lords of Shechem’s Tower heard about it, they went into the vault of the temple of El-berith. 
9:47 When Abimelech was told that all the lords of Shechem’s Tower had gathered there, 
9:48 he and all the people with him went up to Mount Zalmon. Then Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a branch from the trees and lifted it up and laid it on his shoulder. Then he said to the people who were with him, “What you’ve seen me do, hurry and do likewise.” 
9:49 So all the people likewise each cut down his branch and followed Abimelech. He laid them against the vault and set the vault on fire over them. So all the people of Shechem’s Tower also died—about a thousand men and women. 
9:50 Then Abimelech went to Thebez, camped against Thebez and captured it. 
9:51 But there was a strong tower in the center of the city, and all the men and women with all the city leaders fled there and shut themselves in, and went up to the roof of the tower. 
9:52 So Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, and approached the door of the tower to burn it with fire. 
9:53 But a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head and crushed his skull. 
9:54 Then he called quickly to the young man, his armor-bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, lest they say of me, ‘A woman slew him.’” So his young man thrust him through, and he died. 
9:55 So when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they each departed to his place. 
9:56 Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech—what he had done to his father by slaying his 70 brothers. 
9:57 Also all the wickedness of the men of Shechem God requited on their heads. Thus on them came the curse of Jotam son of Jerubbaal. 
10:1 After Abimelech, Tola son of Puah son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to deliver Israel. He dwelt in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. 
10:2 He judged Israel for 23 years, then died and was buried in Shamir. 
10:3 After him Jair the Gileadite arose, and judged Israel for 23 years. 
10:4 He had 30 sons who rode on 30 donkeys and had 30 towns in the land of Gilead, which are called Jair’s Villages to this day. 
10:5 Then Jair died and was buried in Kamon. 
10:6 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
10:7 So </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:8 They shattered and crushed </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
10:9 Then the children of Ammon also crossed over the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin and the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was greatly distressed. 
10:10 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
10:11 So </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:12 the Zidonians, the Amalekites and the Maonites who oppressed you? When you cried out to Me, I delivered you from their hand. 
10:13 Yet you have forsaken Me and worshipped other gods; therefore I will deliver you no more. 
10:14 Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your distress.” 
10:15 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
10:16 Then they removed the foreign gods from among them, and worshipped </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:17 Then the children of Ammon were summoned and camped in Gilead. </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
10:18 The people of the princes of Gilead said one to another, “Whoever begins to fight against the children of Ammon will be chief over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”
11:1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, but he was son of a prostitute, while Gilead was Jephthah’s father. 
11:2 But Gilead’s wife bore him sons, and when the wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, “You won’t inherit in our father’s house, for you are a son of another woman.” 
11:3 Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. Some worthless fellows joined with Jephthah and went out with him. 
11:4 Now it came about after a while that the children of Ammon fought with Israel. 
11:5 When the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah from the land of Tob. 
11:6 They said to Jephthah, “Come and be our chief, so we may fight the children of Ammon.” 
11:7 Jephthah then said to the elders of Gilead, “Didn’t you hate me and drive me out of my father’s house? So why are you coming to me now that you’re in trouble?” 
11:8 “Here is why we’re now turning to you,” the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah. “Come with us, fight the children of Ammon, and then you will become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.” 
11:9 So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you take me back home to fight the children of Ammon, and </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:10 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “Let </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:11 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them, after Jephthah repeated all his terms before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:12 Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon saying, “What have you to do with me, that you have come to me to make war on my land?” 
11:13 The king of the children of Ammon answered the messengers of Jephthah, “Because Israel took away my land, when they came up from Egypt, from the Arnon to the Jabbok as far as the Jordan. Now therefore, return them peaceably.” 
11:14 But Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon, 
11:15 and said to him, “Thus says Jephthah, ‘Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the children of Ammon. 
11:16 For upon departing from Egypt, Israel traveled through the wilderness to the Sea of Reeds and came to Kadesh, 
11:17 then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom saying, “Please, let me pass through your land,” but the king of Edom would not consent. Similarly he sent word to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel, after staying at Kadesh, 
11:18 traveled through the wilderness, around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, came to the east side of the land of Moab and they camped on the other side of the Arnon. But they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab. 
11:19 Then Israel sent messengers to King Sihon of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, “Please, let us pass through your land to my place.” 
11:20 But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his troops, camped in Jahaz and fought against Israel. 
11:21 But </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:22 Thus they possessed all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and from the wilderness as far as the Jordan. 
11:23 So now </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:24 Don’t you possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? Likewise, whatever </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:25 Besides, are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them? 
11:26 While Israel was living in Heshbon and its villages, in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities on both sides of the Arnon for 300 years, why didn’t you try to recover them all that time? 
11:27 So I myself have not transgressed against you, yet you are doing me harm by waging war against me. May </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:28 However, the king of the children of Ammon paid no attention to the words of Jephthah that he sent him. 
11:29 Then the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
11:30 Then Jephthah vowed a vow to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:31 then it will be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return safely from the children of Ammon, it will be </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:32 So Jephthah crossed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them, and </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:33 So he utterly defeated them from Aroer until you come to Minnith—20 towns—and as far as Abel-cheramim. So the children of Ammon were subdued before </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
11:34 Now when Jephthah arrived at his home in Mizpah, behold, his daughter was coming out to meet him with tambourines and with dances. Now she was his only child. Besides her he had no son or daughter. 
11:35 Upon seeing her, he tore his clothes and said, “Alas, my daughter! You made me bow down in grief—you’ve made me miserable! For I have opened my mouth to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:36 “My father, you have opened your mouth to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:37 She said further to her father, “Let this thing be done for me. Let me be alone two months, so that I may go on the mountains and mourn my virginity, I and my companions.” 
11:38 “Go!” he said. So he sent her away for two months. So she left, she and her companions, and mourned on the mountains because of her virginity.
11:39 Then at the end of two months she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow he had made—so she was never intimate with a man. So it became a custom in Israel, 
11:40 that the daughters of Israel would go annually to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
12:1 Then the men of Ephraim were summoned and crossed over to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over to fight against the children of Ammon without calling us to go with you? We will burn your house over you with fire.” 
12:2 So Jephthah responded to them, “I and my people were in a bitter conflict with the children of Ammon, yet when I called you, you didn’t deliver me from their hand. 
12:3 So when I saw that you weren’t going to deliver, I put my life in my hand and crossed over against the children of Ammon, and </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:4 Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought Ephraim. The men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, “You Gileadites are just fugitives of Ephraim in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh.” 
12:5 The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan opposite Ephraim. So when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead would ask him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No,” 
12:6 then they would say to him, “Say now, ‘Shibboleth,’” and he said “Sibboleth” since he could not pronounce it right, then they would seize him and slay him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time 42,000 of Ephraim fell. 
12:7 Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the towns of Gilead. 
12:8 After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 
12:9 Now he had 30 sons, and 30 daughters—he sent them outside and brought in 30 girls from outside for his sons. He judged Israel seven years, 
12:10 then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem. 
12:11 Then after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel. He judged Israel ten years, 
12:12 then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. 
12:13 After him Abdon son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. 
12:14 He had 40 sons and 30 grandsons who rode on 70 donkeys, and he judged Israel eight years. 
12:15 Then Abdon son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
13:1  gave them into the hand of the Philistines for 40 years. 
13:2 Now there was a certain man from Zorah, from a Danite clan, whose name was Manoah. His wife was barren and bore no children. 
13:3 Then the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:4 Now therefore be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing. 
13:5 For behold, you will conceive and bear a son. Let no razor come upon his head, for the boy will be a Nazirite to God from the womb. He will begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.” 
13:6 Then the woman came and told her husband saying, “A man of God came to me and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome! But I did not ask him where he was from, nor did he tell me his name. 
13:7 He said to me, ‘Behold, you will conceive and bear a son. So, drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the child will be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.” 
13:8 Then Manoah entreated </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:9 God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she was sitting in the field, but her husband Manoah was not with her. 
13:10 So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, and said to him, “Look, the man that came to me the other day has appeared to me!” 
13:11 So Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he asked him, “Are you the one who spoke to the woman?” “I am,” he said. 
13:12 Then Manoah said, “Now may your words come about! What will be the child’s rule and his mission?” 
13:13 The angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:14 She should not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, or drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing. She must observe all that I commanded her.” 
13:15 Then Manoah said to the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:16 But the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:17 Then Manoah asked the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:18 But the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:19 Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering and offered them on the rock to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:20 For it came about when the flame went up from off the altar toward heaven that the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:21 But the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:22 Manoah said to his wife, “We will surely die, because we have seen God.” 
13:23 But his wife said to him, “If </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:24 Then the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson. So the boy grew up and </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:25 The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
14:1 Then Samson went down to Timnah and eyed in Timnah a woman, one of the daughters of the Philistines. 
14:2 So he came back and told his father and mother saying, “I have seen a woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines. So now get her for me as a wife.” 
14:3 Then his father and his mother said to him, “Is there no woman among the daughters of your kinsmen, or among all our people, that you are going to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?” But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she is the right one in my eyes.” 
14:4 But his father and mother did not know that it was of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:5 While his father and mother went down to Timnah, Samson went to the vineyards of Timnah, and behold, a young lion came roaring at him. 
14:6 Then the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
14:7 So he went down and talked with the woman, and she looked right in Samson’s eyes. 
14:8 After a while he returned to get her, but turned aside to look at the carcass of the lion; and behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion. 
14:9 So he scraped it into his hands and went on, eating as he went. Now when he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them and they ate it, though he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey from the carcass of the lion. 
14:10 Then his father went down to the woman, and Samson made a banquet there, for so the young men used to do. 
14:11 Now it came to pass, when they saw him, they brought 30 companions to be with him. 
14:12 Then Samson said to them, “Let me now propose a riddle to you. If you can indeed solve it for me during the seven days of the banquet, and figure it out, then I will give you 30 linen garments and 30 changes of clothes; 
14:13 but if you cannot solve it for me, then you must give me 30 linen garments and 30 changes of clothes.” “Propose your riddle,” they said to him. “Let’s hear it!” 
14:14 So he said to them, “Out of the eater came forth food, out of the strong came forth sweet.” But for three days they could not solve the riddle. 
14:15 Now on the seventh day, they said to Samson’s wife, “Coax your husband so that he will explain the riddle to us—or else we will burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you invited us to impoverish us?” 
14:16 So Samson’s wife wept before him and said, “You only hate me! You don’t love me! You proposed a riddle to the sons of my people—yet you haven’t explained it to me!” “Look,” he said, “I haven’t explained it to my father or my mother, so should I explain it to you?” 
14:17 But she wept before him the seven days while their banquet lasted. So it was on the seventh day he told her, because she nagged him. Then she told the riddle to the sons of her people. 
14:18 So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day, before the sun went down, “What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?” But he responded to them, “If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer, you wouldn’t have solved my riddle.” 
14:19 Then the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
14:20 But Samson’s wife was given to his companion who had been his best man.
15:1 But after a while, during the time of wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat. “I am going to my wife in her room,” he said. But her father would not let him enter. 
15:2 “I thought for sure you had utterly hated her,” her father said, “so I gave her to your best man. Her younger sister—isn’t she better than her? Please, let her be yours instead.” 
15:3 Then Samson said to them, “This time I am blameless from the Philistines when I do harm to them.” 
15:4 So Samson went and caught 300 foxes, and took torches, turned the foxes tail to tail and put one torch between every two tails. 
15:5 Then he set fire to the torches and released them into the standing grain of the Philistines, Thus he burned up both the stacks and the standing grain, along with vineyards and olive trees. 
15:6 Then the Philistines asked, “Who did this?” They were told, “Samson, son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his best man.” So the Philistines came up and burnt her and her father with fire. 
15:7 Then Samson said to them, “Since you have acted like this, surely I will take revenge on you—after that I will quit.” 
15:8 So he struck them leg upon thigh with a great slaughter. Then he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam. 
15:9 Then the Philistines went up and camped in Judah and spread out in Lehi. 
15:10 The men of Judah asked, “Why have you marched against us?” They replied, “We have come to arrest Samson—to do to him as he did to us.” 
15:11 Then 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam and said to Samson, “Don’t you realize that the Philistines are ruling over us? So what is this that you have done to us?” He said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.” 
15:12 “We have come down to bind you,” they said to him, “so that we may hand you over to the Philistines.” So Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you yourselves won’t kill me.” 
15:13 “No, we won’t kill you,” they said to him, “but we will bind you fast and hand you over to them.” So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock. 
15:14 When he arrived at Lehi, the Philistines shouted upon meeting him. But the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
15:15 Then he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out and took it, and killed a thousand men with it. 
15:16 Then Samson said, “With the jawbone of a donkey, a heap … two heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey I struck down a thousand men.” 
15:17 As soon as he had finished speaking, he threw the jawbone from his hand. Then he named that place Ramat-lehi. 
15:18 Then he became very thirsty, so he called to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:19 But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out of it. When he drank, he regained his strength and revived. Therefore he called it En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day. 
15:20 Then he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines for 20 years.
16:1 Once Samson went to Gaza and eyed a prostitute there, so he went to her. 
16:2 The Gazites were told, “Samson has come here.” So they surrounded him, lay in ambush for him all night at the gate of the city, and kept quiet all night saying, “When morning light comes, then we kill him.” 
16:3 But Samson lay in bed till midnight, got up at midnight, grabbed the doors of the city gate along with the two gateposts and pulled them up bar and all. Then he put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is near Hebron. 
16:4 It came about afterward that he fell in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. 
16:5 So the Philistine lords came up to her and said to her, “Coax him, see where his great strength comes from and by what we may overpower him, so we may bind him to subdue him—then we’ll each of us give you 1,100 pieces of silver.” 
16:6 So Delilah said to Samson, “Tell me please, where does your great strength come from? How could you be bound to subdue you?” 
16:7 Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven fresh cords that have never been dried, then I would be weak and be like any other man.” 
16:8 So the Philistine lords brought up to her seven fresh cords that had never been dried, and she bound him with them, 
16:9 while an ambush was waiting in an inner room. “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” she said to him. But he broke the cords just as a strand of straw snaps when it touches fire. So his strength remained unknown. 
16:10 Delilah said to Samson, “Oh, you deceived me! You lied to me! Now tell me please, how you can be bound?” 
16:11 He told her, “If they only bind me with new ropes never used for work, then I will be weak and be like any other man.” 
16:12 So Delilah took new ropes, tied him up with them and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” Yet while the ambush was waiting in the inner room, he snapped them from his arms like a thread. 
16:13 So Delilah said to Samson, “Up to now you’ve mocked me and told me lies! Tell me how you can be bound!” He told her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web of a loom.” 
16:14 So she pinned it with a pin and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he awoke from his sleep and pulled away the pin of the loom and the web. 
16:15 “How can you say, ‘I love you,’” she said to him, “when your heart is not with me? This is three times you’ve deceived me and not told me where your great strength comes from.” 
16:16 Now it came about when she nagged him daily with her speeches and kept bothering him, his soul was annoyed to death. 
16:17 So he divulged to her all his heart and said to her, “No razor has ever been upon my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I will be weak and be like any other man.” 
16:18 Now when Delilah realized that he had confided to her all his heart, she sent and called for the Philistine lords saying, “Come up this time, for he has told me all his heart.” So the Philistine lords came up to her and brought the silver in their hand. 
16:19 Then she made him sleep upon her knees, and she called for a man and had the seven locks of his head shaved off. She even began to humiliate him while his strength departed from him. 
16:20 Then she said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” When he awoke from his sleep, he thought, “I’ll go out as at other times, and shake myself off.” He did not comprehend that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:21 Then the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes. They brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze chains, and he became a grinder in the prison. 
16:22 However, the hair of his head began to grow again after it was shaved off.
16:23 Now the Philistine lords gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, as they said, “Our god has given our enemy Samson into our hand.” 
16:24 When the people saw him, they praised their god, as they said, “Our god has given into our hand our enemy and the destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us.” 
16:25 Now it came about when their hearts were merry that they said, “Call for Samson, that he may amuse us.” So they called for Samson from the prison, and he did make them laugh, when they made him stand between the pillars. 
16:26 Then Samson said to the lad that held him by the hand, “Let me feel the pillars on which the temple rests, so I may lean on them.” 
16:27 Now the temple was full of men and women. All the Philistine lords were there and about 3,000 men and women on the roof looking on while Samson was amusing them. 
16:28 Then Samson called out to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:29 Then Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the temple rested and leaned on them, one with his right hand and the other with his left. 
16:30 Then Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He bent with all his might so that the temple fell on the lords and on all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he killed during his life. 
16:31 Then his kinsmen and all his father’s household came down, lifted him, brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. For he had judged Israel 20 years.
17:1 Now there was a man of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah. 
17:2 And he said to his mother, “The 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, which you also repeated it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.” And his mother said, “Blessed be my son of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:3 And he returned the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother said, “I wholly dedicate the silver from my hand to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:4 So when he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took 200 pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith who made it into a graven image and a molten image; and they were kept in the house of Micah. 
17:5 Now the man Micah had a shrine of gods, and he made an ephod and household idols, and consecrated one of his sons to become his priest. 
17:6 In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes. 
17:7 Now there was a young man from Bethlehem of Judah—of the clan of Judah—who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. 
17:8 Then the man departed from the town, from Bethlehem of Judah, to sojourn wherever he could find a place; and as he journeyed he arrived to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah. 
17:9 And Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?” And he replied to him, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem of Judah, and I am travelling to stay wherever I may find a place.” 
17:10 So Micah said to him, “Stay with me and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year, and a suit of apparel, and your provision.” So the Levite went in. 
17:11 And the Levite was content to stay with the man, and the young man became to him as one of his sons. 
17:12 So Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in the house of Micah. 
17:13 Then Micah said, “Now I know that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:1 In those days there was no king in Israel, and in those days the tribe of Dan was seeking an inheritance for itself to settle in, for to that day no territory had fallen to them for an inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel. 
18:2 So the children of Dan sent five men from their clan, out of their entire population, men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and explore it, and said to them, “Go, explore the land.” When they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there. 
18:3 When they were near the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young man, the Levite. So they turned aside there and asked him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What do you have here?” 
18:4 He said to them, “Thus and thus Micah did for me—he hired me and I became his priest.” 
18:5 “Please inquire of God,” they said to him, “so we may know whether our way that we are going will be successful.” 
18:6 “Go in peace,” the priest said to them. “The way that you are going has </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:7 Then the five men left and came to Laish, and saw the people there living securely, like the Zidonians, tranquil and unsuspecting. For there was no humiliation or anything oppressive in the land. Moreover, they were distant from the Zidonians and had no dealings with anybody. 
18:8 When they came back to their kinsmen at Zorah and Eshtaol, their kinsmen asked them, “What do you say?” 
18:9 “Arise, let’s go up against them!” they said. “For we have seen the land—see, it’s very good. Yet you’re sitting still! Don’t be sluggish! Go enter, possess the land! 
18:10 When you get there, you will come to unsuspecting people. The land is spacious. For God has put it in your hand—a place where there is no lack of anything on the earth.” 
18:11 So from the Danite clan from Zorah and Eshtaol, 600 men set out, armed with weapons of war. 
18:12 They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. Therefore they called that place Mahaneh-Dan to this day—behold, it is west of Kiriath-jearim. 
18:13 From there they passed on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah’s house. 
18:14 Then the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish said to their kinsmen, “Do you know that in these houses there are an ephod, household idols, a carved image and a molten image? Now therefore, consider what you have to do.” 
18:15 So they turned aside there and came to the house of the young Levite at Micah’s house, and asked him about his welfare. 
18:16 Now the 600 men of the children of Dan, armed with their weapons of war, were standing by the entrance of the gate. 
18:17 The five men who had gone to spy out the land went up and entered there. They took the carved image, the ephod, the household idols and the molten image, while the priest was standing by the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed with weapons of war. 
18:18 Now after these had gone into Micah’s house and taken the carved image, the ephod, the household idols and the molten image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?” 
18:19 “Be quiet!” they said to him. “Put your hand on your mouth and go with us and be to us a father and a priest! Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man or to be priest to a tribe and a clan in Israel?” 
18:20 So the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the household idols and the carved image, and went along among the people. 
18:21 So they turned and set off, and placed the little ones and the cattle and the goods in front of them. 
18:22 When they were at a good distance from Micah’s house, the men that were in the houses near Micah’s house gathered and caught up with the children of Dan. 
18:23 They called out to the children of Dan, who turned their faces around and said to Micah, “What’s the matter with you that you have called them out?” 
18:24 “You have taken away my gods which I made,” he said, “and the priest, and walked away! What do I have left? And how then do you say to me, ‘What’s the matter with you?’” 
18:25 But the children of Dan said to him, “Don’t let your voice be heard among us, lest bitter fellows fall upon you, and you lose your life with the lives of your household.” 
18:26 Then the children of Dan went on their way, and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house. 
18:27 Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and came to Laish, to a tranquil and unsuspecting people, and struck them with the edge of the sword, and they burned the town with fire. 
18:28 There was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon and they had no alliance with anyone. It was in the valley near Beth-rehob. Then they rebuilt the town and lived in it. 
18:29 So they called the name of the town Dan, after the name of their father Dan born to Israel; however, the former name of the town was Laish. 
18:30 The children of Dan set up for themselves the carved image. Jonathan son of Gershom son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the exile from the land. 
18:31 So they set them up Micah’s carved image that he had made, all the time that the House of God was in Shiloh.
19:1 Now in those days, there was no king in Israel. There was a certain Levite dwelling in a remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, who got himself a concubine out of Bethlehem in Judah. 
19:2 But his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him to her father’s house to Bethlehem in Judah, and was there for a period of four months. 
19:3 Then her husband arose and went after her to speak kindly to her to bring her back. He had his servant and a pair of donkeys with him. So she brought him into her father’s house, and when the father of the young woman saw him, he was glad to meet him. 
19:4 His father-in-law, the young woman’s father, kept him staying with him three days, eating, drinking and lodging there. 
19:5 Now on the fourth day they woke up early in the morning, and he rose up to depart, but the young woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you may go.” 
19:6 So the two of them sat down and ate and drank together. Then the young woman’s father said to the man, “Please, be willing to spend the night, and let your heart be merry.” 
19:7 Then the man rose up to depart, but his father-in-law urged him, so he lodged there again. 
19:8 Then he woke up early in the morning on the fifth day to depart, but the young woman’s father said, “Please, strengthen yourself and tarry until afternoon!” So both of them ate. 
19:9 And when the man rose up to depart, he and his concubine and his servant, his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, said to him, “Behold now, the day is waning toward evening; please, spend the night. Behold, the day is drawing to a close; lodge here and let your heart be merry. Then tomorrow get up early for your journey so that you may go home.” 
19:10 But the man would not spend that night, so he rose up and departed and came to a place near Jebus—that is, Jerusalem—and with him were a pair of saddled donkeys and his concubine. 
19:11 When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, “Come, please, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in it.” 
19:12 But his master said to him, “We will not turn aside into a city of foreigners, who are not of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
19:13 “Come on,” he said to his servant, “let’s try to reach one of these places—we’ll spend the night in Gibeah or in Ramah.” 
19:14 So they passed on and went their way, and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin. 
19:15  Then they turned aside there to enter and lodge in Gibeah. When he went in, he sat down in the town square, for there was no one who took them into his house to spend the night. 
19:16 Now behold, an old man was coming from his work in the field at evening. The man was of the hill country of Ephraim but dwelled in Gibeah, while the rest of the men of the place were Benjamites. 
19:17 When he lifted up his eyes and saw the wayfaring man in the open square of the town, the old man asked, “Where are you going, and where do you come from?” 
19:18 “We are passing from Bethlehem of Judah,” he said to him, “to the remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, for I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem of Judah. But now I am going to the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:19 Nevertheless, there is both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and also bread and wine for me, your handmaid, and the young man that is with your servants—there is no lack of anything.” 
19:20 The old man said, “</span><span class="it"><span class="content">Shalom
19:21 So he brought him into his house and gave the donkeys fodder, and they washed their feet and ate and drank. 
19:22 While they were making their hearts merry, behold, some worthless men of the town surrounded the house. Pounding the door, they shouted to the owner of the house, “Bring out the man that came into your house,” they said to the old man, “so we may have relations with him.” 
19:23 But the man, the owner of the house, went out to them and said to them, “No, my fellows, please don’t do this evil. After all, this man has come into my house. Don’t commit this disgraceful deed. 
19:24 Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine—I will bring them out to you now, and you may abuse them and do to them whatever pleases you, but don’t do such a degrading thing to this man!” 
19:25 But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and brought her out to them, and they raped her and abused her all the night until morning. When dawn broke, they let her go. 
19:26 As the morning came, the woman came and fell down at the doorway of the man’s house where her master was, until it was full daylight. 
19:27 When her master rose up in the morning opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way, behold, the woman his concubine had collapsed at the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold. 
19:28 “Get up!” he said to her, “and let’s go.” But there was no response. So he placed her on the donkey. Then the man got up and went to his place. 
19:29 Now when he entered his house, he took a knife and laid hold of his concubine and cut her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her to all the territory of Israel. 
19:30 So it was, that everyone who saw it said, ‘“Nothing like this has ever happened or been seen, since the day that </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:1 Then all </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:2 The chiefs of the people and of the tribes of Israel presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God—400,000 foot soldiers armed with swords. 
20:3 Now the children of Benjamin heard that </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:4 So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered and said, “I came with my concubine to Gibeah of Benjamin to spend the night. 
20:5 Then men of Gibeah rose against me and surrounded the house over me at night. They intended to kill me, but instead, they raped my concubine until she died. 
20:6 So I took my concubine and cut her into pieces and sent her throughout the land of Israel’s possession. For they have committed something obscene and degrading in Israel. 
20:7 Behold, all you sons of Israel, give your advice and counsel here.” 
20:8 Then all the people arose as one man saying, “Not one of us will go to his tent, nor will any of us return to his house. 
20:9 But now this is what we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot. 
20:10 We will take ten men of a hundred throughout the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to supply provisions for the troops, so that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, they may do to them according to all the disgrace that they have committed in Israel.” 
20:11 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the town, knit together as one man. 
20:12 And the tribes of Israel sent men through the tribe of Benjamin saying, “What is this wickedness that has taken place among you? 
20:13 Now therefore, give up the men, the worthless fellows that are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and purge this evil from Israel.” But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their kinsmen </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:14 So the children of Benjamin were gathered from their towns to Gibeah, to go out to battle against </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:15 On that day the children of Benjamin mustered 26,000 swordsmen from the towns, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered 700 chosen men. 
20:16 Out of all these troops there were 700 chosen men that were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss. 
20:17 Meanwhile the men of Israel, apart from Benjamin, numbered 400,000 swordsmen; all men of war. 
20:18 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:19 So </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:20 The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and arrayed for battle against Gibeah. 
20:21 But the children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and struck down 22,000 men of Israel on the field that day. 
20:22 But the people of the men of Israel rallied their strength and arrayed for battle again in the same place where they had arrayed themselves the first day. 
20:23 Yet </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:24 So </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:25 Benjamin came out against them from Gibeah again the second day and struck down 18,000 of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:26 Then all </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:27 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:28 and Pinchas son of Eleazar son of Aaron had ministered before it in those days) saying, “Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or should I cease?” </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:29 So Israel set men in ambush against Gibeah on all sides. 
20:30 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:31 The children of Benjamin came out against the people, but they were drawn away from the town, and they began to strike and kill some of the people (about 30 men of Israel), as at other times, on the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah. 
20:32 So the children of Benjamin said, “They are defeated before us as before.” But </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:33 Then all the troops of Israel rose up from their place and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar, and the troops of Israel in ambush burst out of their place west of Geba. 
20:34 Then 10,000 troops chosen from all Israel made a frontal attack on Gibeah, and the battle became fierce; but the Benjamites did not know not that disaster was about to strike them. 
20:35 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:36 So the children of Benjamin realized that they were defeated. Now the men of Israel had yielded ground to Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush that they had laid against Gibeah. 
20:37 So the men in ambush rushed suddenly upon Gibeah, then the men in another ambush advanced and struck the whole town with the edge of the sword. 
20:38 Now there was a prearranged sign between the men of Israel and the men in ambush—they would make a great beacon of smoke rise up from the town—
20:39 then the men of Israel would return to the battle. When Benjamin began to strike, killing about 30 of the men of Israel, they said, “Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle.” 
20:40 But when the beacon began to arise up from the town in a pillar of smoke, Benjamin looked behind them, and behold, the whole town was going up in smoke to the sky. 
20:41 Then the men of Israel turned back, and the men of Benjamin were terrified, for they realized that disaster had struck them. 
20:42 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel toward the way of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them. Meanwhile those who came from the towns massacred them in their midst. 
20:43 They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them and easily overtook them, near Gibeah toward the east. 
20:44 Thus 18,000 men of Benjamin fell, all them were men of valor. 
20:45 Then the rest turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, but they picked off 5,000 of them on the highways. They pressed hard after them to Gidom, and struck down 2,000 more of them. 
20:46 So all who fell that day of Benjamin were 25,000 men drawing the sword—all of them were men of valor. 
20:47 But 600 men turned and escaped into the wilderness, to the rock of Rimmon, and stayed at the rock of Rimmon four months. 
20:48 The men of Israel turned back against the children of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword—the entire city, the cattle and all that they found. They also set on fire all the towns that they found. 
21:1 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah saying, “None of us will give his daughter to Benjamin in marriage.” 
21:2 So the people came to Bethel and sat there till evening before God, and lifted up their voices and wept bitterly. 
21:3 They said, “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:4 Then it was on the next day that the people rose up early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. 
21:5 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
21:6 Now </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
21:7 What should we do about providing wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:8 Then they inquired, “Which one of the tribes of Israel that did not go up to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:9 For when the people were numbered, behold not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there. 
21:10 So the congregation sent 12,000 valiant warriors there, and commanded them saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones. 
21:11 Now this is the thing that you will do: you are to utterly destroy every male and every woman who has lain with a man.” 
21:12 So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 young virgins who had not known man by lying with him. They brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. 
21:13 Then the whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom
21:14 When Benjamin returned at that time, they gave them the women whom they had spared from the women of Jabesh-gilead. Yet they were not enough for them. 
21:15 So the people were sorry for Benjamin because </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:16 Then the elders of the congregation said, “What should we do about wives for those who are left, since the women have been destroyed out of Benjamin?” 
21:17 They said “The survivors of Benjamin must have heirs, so that a tribe would not be blotted out from Israel. 
21:18 Yet we cannot give them wives of our daughters,” for </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
21:19 So they said, “Behold, there is the feast of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:20 So they commanded the children of Benjamin saying, “Go and hide in the vineyards, 
21:21 and watch, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh should come out to join in the dances, then come out of the vineyards, and let each of you catch his wife from among the daughters of Shiloh. Then go to the land of Benjamin. 
21:22 So it will be, if their fathers or brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, ‘Grant them graciously for us, because we did not provide each one of them his wife in battle—nor did you give the girls to them, else you would now be guilty.’” 
21:23 So the children of Benjamin did so, and took the number of wives from the dancers whom they carried off. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and rebuilt the towns and settled in them. 
21:24 So </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
21:25 In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
