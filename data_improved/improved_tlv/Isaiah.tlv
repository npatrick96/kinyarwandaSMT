1:1 The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah: 
1:2 Listen! Heavens, and hear, earth, for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:3 The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its manger, but Israel does not know, My people do not understand.” 
1:4 . They have despised Israel’s Holy One. They have turned backwards. 
1:5 Where will you be struck again, as you stray away more and more? The whole head is sick, the whole heart faint. 
1:6 From the foot to the head there is no soundness. Wounds, bruises and raw sores: not pressed, nor bandaged, nor softened with oil. 
1:7 Your land is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your fields, strangers devour it in your presence—a desolation, overthrown by strangers. 
1:8 So the Daughter of Zion is left as a </span><span class="it"><span class="content">sukkah
1:9 Unless </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:10 Hear the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:11 “For what is it to Me— the multitude of your sacrifices?” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:12 When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your hand— trampling My courts? 
1:13 Bring no more worthless offerings! Incense is an abomination to Me. New Moon and Shabbat, the calling of convocations —I cannot endure it— iniquity with solemn assembly. 
1:14 Your New Moons and your Festivals My soul hates! They are a burden to Me. I am weary to bear them. 
1:15 When you spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you. When you multiply prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood!”
1:16 “Wash and make yourselves clean. Put away the evil of your deeds from before My eyes. Cease to do evil. 
1:17 Learn to do good, seek justice, relieve the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for the widow.” 
1:18 “Come now, let us reason together,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:19 If you are willing and obey, you will eat the good of the land. 
1:20 But if you refuse and rebel, you will be devoured with the sword.” For the mouth of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:21 How the Faithful City became a harlot! She once was full of justice, righteousness lodged in her— but now murderers! 
1:22 Your silver has become dross, your wine diluted by water. 
1:23 Your princes are rebellious and friends with thieves. Everyone loves a bribe and chases after rewards. They do not defend the orphan, nor does a widow’s case come to them. 
1:24 Therefore says the Lord </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:25 Then I will turn My hand on you, purge away your dross, and remove all your alloy. 
1:26 I will restore your judges as at first, your counselors as at the start. Afterward you will be called City of Righteousness, Faithful City. 
1:27 Zion will be redeemed with justice, her repentant with righteousness.” 
1:28 But there will be a crushing of transgressors and sinners together. Forsaking </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
1:29 For they will be ashamed of the sacred oaks that you desired, and embarrassed because of the gardens that you have chosen. 
1:30 For you will be like an oak of withering leaf, like a garden that has no water. 
1:31 So the strong will become tinder and his work like a spark— both will burn together, and no one will quench them.
2:1 The word which Isaiah, son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem: 
2:2 It will come to pass in the last days that the mountain of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:3 Then many peoples will go and say: “Come, let us go up to the mountain of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:4 He will judge between the nations and decide for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning knives. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, nor will they learn war any more. 
2:5 Come house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:6 For You have forsaken Your people, the house of Jacob. For they are filled with soothsayers from the east, and they have clapped hands with the children of foreigners. 
2:7 Their land also is full of silver and gold, nor is there any limit to their treasures. Their land also is full of horses, nor is there any limit to their chariots. 
2:8 Their land also is full of idols. They worship the work of their hands, what their own fingers have made. 
2:9 So humanity bows down as each one lowers himself. Pardon them not! 
2:10 Enter into the rock and hide in the dust, for fear of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:11 The man of haughty eyes is humbled, the lofty ones brought low, for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:12 For the day of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:13 against all the cedars of Lebanon that are lofty and lifted up, against all the oaks of Bashan, 
2:14 against all the high mountains, against all the exalted hills, 
2:15 against every high tower, against every fortified wall, 
2:16 against all the Tarshish ships, and against all the luxury boats. 
2:17 The pride of man will be humbled, the arrogance of men abased, for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:18 The idols will completely pass away. 
2:19 People will go into the caves of the rocks and into the holes of the earth, because of the fear of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:20 In that day a man will cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which they made to worship, to the moles and to the bats! 
2:21 They go into the clefts of the rocks and the crevices of the crags, because of fear of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
2:22 Stop trusting in mankind —whose breath is in his nose— for what is he really worth?
3:1 For behold! The Lord, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:2 mighty man and man of war, judge, and prophet, fortune-teller and elder, 
3:3 captain of 50 and man of rank, counselor, crafty magician and cunning charmer. 
3:4 I will set children as their rulers. Capricious ones will govern them. 
3:5 The people will oppress one another— each one by his fellow, each one by his neighbor. The child will be insolent to the aged, and dishonorable to the honorable. 
3:6 When a man takes hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying: “You have a cloak, you be our ruler! This ruin is under your charge.” 
3:7 In that day he will protest, saying: “I’m no healer! In my house is no bread or cloak. Don’t make me a ruler of people!” 
3:8 For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah is fallen. For their tongue and their actions are against </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:9 The expression of their faces bears witness against them. They display their sin like Sodom— they do not hide it. </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Oy
3:10 Say to the righteous, he will be well, eating the fruit of their deeds. 
3:11  , the wicked! It will be bad for him, for the dealing of his hands will be done to him. 
3:12 My people! Children are their oppressors and women rule over them. My people! Your guides mislead you and destroy the way of your paths. 
3:13  arises to contend a case, and stands to judge the people. 
3:14  will enter into judgment with the elders of His people and with the princes: “You have devoured the vineyard. The plunder of the poor is in your houses. 
3:15 What do you mean by crushing My people and grinding the face of the poor?” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:16 Moreover </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:17 therefore </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:18 In that day </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:19 pendants and bracelets, veils, 
3:20 headdresses, armlets, sashes, perfume vials, amulets, 
3:21 rings and nose-jewels, 
3:22 festal robes, capes, cloaks, purses, 
3:23 lace scarves, fine linen, turbans and veils. 
3:24 Now it will come to pass: Instead of sweet spices there will be rottenness; instead of a sash, rags; instead of curled hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty. 
3:25 Your men will fall by the sword, and your warriors in battle. 
3:26 Her gates will lament and mourn. Desolate, she will sit on the ground.
4:1 Seven women will grab hold of one man in that day, saying: “We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel. Only let us be called by your name— take away our reproach!”
4:2 In that day the Branch of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:3 So it will come to pass that whoever is left in Zion and whoever remains in Jerusalem will be called holy—everyone who is recorded among the living in Jerusalem. 
4:4 After </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:5 then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:6 Then there will be a </span><span class="it"><span class="content">sukkah
5:1 Let me sing of my beloved, a song of my beloved, about His vineyard. My beloved had a vineyard in a very fertile hill. 
5:2 He dug it out and cleared its stones, planted it with a choice vine, built a tower in the midst of it, and even cut out a winepress. He expected it to yield good grapes, but it yielded worthless grapes. 
5:3 So now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and people of Judah, please judge between me and my vineyard. 
5:4 What more was there to do for my vineyard that I have not done? Why then, when I expected it to yield good grapes, did it yield worthless grapes? 
5:5 So now, I will make known to you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge, and it will be eaten up. I will break down the fence, and it will be trodden down. 
5:6 I will lay it waste: it will not be pruned or hoed, but briers and thorns will come up. I will also command the clouds not to rain on it. 
5:7 For the vineyard of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:8 Woe to those who join house to house and merge field to field, until there is no room, and you will live alone in the midst of the land! 
5:9 In my ears, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:10 Ten acres of vineyard will yield six gallons, and an omer of seed will yield one ephah. 
5:11 Woe to those who rise up early in the morning— so they may pursue liquor, who stay up late at night, until wine inflames them! 
5:12 Harp and lyre, tambourine and flute, and wine are at their banquets. They do not notice </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:13 “Therefore My people are in captivity for lack of knowledge. Their honorable men are famished and their multitudes parched with thirst. 
5:14 Therefore </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Sheol
5:15 So humanity will be bowed down mankind will be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty humbled.” 
5:16 But </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:17 Then lambs will graze as if in their own pasture, and nomads will eat in the ruins of the wealthy. 
5:18  to those that drag iniquity along with cords of deceit, and sin as if with a cart rope! 
5:19 They say: “Let Him hurry up and hasten His work, so we may see it! Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, so we may know it!” 
5:20  to those who call evil good and good evil, who present darkness as light and light as darkness, who present bitter as sweet, and sweet as bitter! 
5:21  to those who are wise in their own eyes, and clever in their own sight! 
5:22  to those who are heroes at drinking wine, and valiant at mixing drinks, 
5:23 who justify the wicked for a bribe, and deprive the innocent of justice! 
5:24 Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes straw, and as chaff collapses into the flame, so their root will be like rot, and their blossom will go up like dust. For they have rejected the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
5:25 Therefore </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
5:26 He will lift up a banner to nations far off, and will whistle for them from the ends of the earth. Look! Swiftly, speedily they come! 
5:27 None will be weary and none stumble among them; none will slumber or sleep; no belt will be loose at the waist; no strap of sandals be broken. 
5:28 Their arrows are sharp and all their bows bent; their horse hooves will be like flint and their wheels like a whirlwind. 
5:29 Their roaring will be like a lion. They will growl like young lions— yes, they will roar, seize their prey and carry it away safely— and there will be none to rescue. 
5:30 They will roar against them like the roaring of the sea. If one looks to the land, behold, darkness and distress! The light is darkened by the clouds.
6:1 In the year of King Uzziah’s death, I saw </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:2 Seraphim were standing above Him. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 
6:3 One called out to another, and said: “Holy, holy, holy, is </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:4 Then the posts of the door trembled at the voice of those who called, and the House was filled with smoke. 
6:5 Then I said: “</span><span class="it"><span class="content">Oy
6:6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, with a glowing coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.
6:7  He touched my mouth with it and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips. Your iniquity is taken away, and your sins atoned for.” 
6:8 Then I heard the voice of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:9 Then He said: “Go! Tell this people: ‘Hear without understanding, and see without perceiving.’ 
6:10 Make the heart of this people fat, their ears heavy, and their eyes blind. Else they would see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and return, and be healed.” 
6:11 Then I said, “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:12  will drive people far away. The desertion of the land will be vast. 
6:13 Though a tenth still be in it, it will again be burned. As a terebinth tree or as an oak whose stump remains when cut down, so the holy seed will be the stump.” 
7:1 Now it came about in the days of Ahaz son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that King Rezin of Aram and King Pekah, son of Remaliah of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. 
7:2 When it was reported to the house of David saying: “Aram is camped in Ephraim,” his heart as well as the heart of his people shook like the trees of the forest shaking with the wind. 
7:3 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:4 and say to him, ‘Keep calm and be quiet. Do not fear nor be faint-hearted because of these two stubs of smoldering firebrands, because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram, nor of the son of Remaliah, 
7:5 because Aram has plotted harm against you, along with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah saying, 
7:6 “Let us go up against Judah, terrorize it, divide it for ourselves, and appoint Tabeel’s son as king in the midst of it.” 
7:7 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:8 For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within 65 years Ephraim will be broken and not be a people. 
7:9 The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If you do not trust, you will not stand.”
7:10 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:11 “Ask for a sign from </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:12 But Ahaz said, “I won’t ask—I wouldn’t test </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:13 Then he said, “Hear now, house of David! Is it a small thing for you to weary men? Will you also weary my God? 
7:14 Therefore </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:15 He will be eating curds and honey by the time he knows to refuse evil and choose good. 
7:16 For before the boy knows to refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings you dread will be abandoned. 
7:17  will bring—on you, on your people and on your father’s house such days as have never come since the day Ephraim separated from Judah—the king of Assyria! 
7:18 In that day </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:19 Then they will come, all of them— and will settle in the steep wadis and in the clefts of the cliffs and in all the thorn bushes and in all the watering holes. 
7:20 In that day </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:21 In that day it will be that a man will rear a calf and two sheep, 
7:22 and from the abundant milk they give, he will eat curds— for anyone left in the land will eat curds and honey. 
7:23 In that day it will be that every place where there were 1,000 vines worth 1,000 silver shekels will become briers and thorns. 
7:24 With arrows and bows one will come there, since all the land will become briers and thorns. 
7:25 As for all the hills that were tilled with the hoe—you will not go there for fear of briers and thorns. Instead it will be for grazing of oxen and roaming of sheep.
8:1 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:2 So I took for myself trustworthy witnesses—Uriah the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
8:3 Then I went to the prophetess; and she conceived and bore a son. Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:4 For before the child will have knowledge to cry ‘my father!’ or ‘my mother!’ the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria.” 
8:5 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:6 “Because these people have refused the softly flowing waters of Shiloah, and rejoice with Rezin and Remaliah’s son, 
8:7 therefore behold, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:8 Then it will sweep through Judah, overflow as it passes through, reaching even to the neck! So the spread of its wings will be the full breadth of your land! Immanuel! 
8:9 Make an uproar, O peoples— but you will be broken in pieces. Give ear, all you of far countries. Arm yourselves—yet be shattered! Arm yourselves—yet be shattered! 
8:10 Take counsel together, but it will amount to nothing. Speak a word, but it will not stand. For God is with us! 
8:11 For thus </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:12  “Do not say: ‘It’s a conspiracy!’ about everything that these people call a conspiracy. You must not fear or tremble at what they fear. 
8:13 , Him will you sanctify, and let Him be your fear, trembling at Him. 
8:14 He will be a Sanctuary, but a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
8:15 Many among them will stumble, fall, and be broken, snared and caught. 
8:16 Bind up the testimony, seal the instruction with My disciples. 
8:17 I will wait for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:18 Here I am with the children that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:19 When they say to you: “Consult the mediums and necromancers who chirp and mutter,” shouldn’t a people seek their God? Should a people consult the dead on behalf of the living? 
8:20 To </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
8:21 They will pass this way that are hard-pressed and hungry, and it will turn out that when they are hungry, they will become enraged and curse their king and their God. Whether they turn their faces upward 
8:22 or look to the earth, behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish, and they will be driven into darkness.
9:1 The people walking in darkness will see a great light. Upon those dwelling in the land of the shadow of death, light will shine. 
9:2 You will multiply the nation. You will increase the joy. They will rejoice before You like the joy in the harvest, as they revel when they divide spoil. 
9:3 For You will break the burdensome yoke and the rod on his shoulder— the war-club of his oppressor— as in the day of Midian. 
9:4 For every stomping boot quaking and cloak rolled in blood will be for burning— fuel for the fire.
9:5 For to us a child is born, a son will be given to us, and the government will be upon His shoulder. His Name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God My Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. 
9:6 Of the increase of His government and </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom
9:7  sent a word to Jacob, and it fell upon Israel. 
9:8 All the people will know what Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria say in pride and in arrogance of heart: 
9:9 “The bricks are fallen, but we will rebuild with cut stones. The sycamores are cut down, but we will replace them with cedars.” 
9:10 Therefore </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
9:11 The Arameans from the east and the Philistines from the west— they will devour Israel with open mouth. For all this His anger is not turned away, yet His hand is still outstretched. 
9:12 Yet the people will not turn back to the One who strikes them, nor will they seek </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
9:13 So </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
9:14 The elder and the man of rank— he is the head. The prophet who teaches falsehood— he is the tail. 
9:15 The leaders of this people lead them astray. Those they mislead are swallowed up. 
9:16 Therefore </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
9:17 For wickedness burns like a fire and consumes the briers and thorns It kindles the thickets of the forest, so they roll up in a column of smoke. 
9:18 By the wrath of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
9:19 One grabs with the right hand but is hungry, and eats with the left hand but is not satisfied. Everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm— 
9:20 Manasseh will devour Ephraim, and Ephraim, Manasseh, both are against Judah. For all this His anger is not turned away, yet His hand is outstretched.
9:21
10:1  to those enacting unjust decrees and recording corrupt legislation, 
10:2 to deprive the helpless of justice and rob the rights of the poor of My people, so that widows may be their spoil and orphans their prey! 
10:3 What will you do in the day of visitation, when desolation comes from afar? To whom will you flee for help? Where will you leave your wealth? 
10:4 One can only crouch among the captives or collapse among the slain. For all this His anger is not turned away, yet His hand is still outstretched. 
10:5  to Assyria, the rod of My anger— the club in their hand is My indignation! 
10:6 I am sending it against an ungodly nation, and against the people of My fury I am commissioning it, to take spoil and plunder, to trample them down like mud in the streets. 
10:7 Yet that is not what Assyria intends, nor is that what he is thinking about. Rather his heart is to destroy, and to cut down nations—only a few! 
10:8 For he says: “Aren’t all my princes kings? 
10:9 Isn’t Calno like Carchemish? Isn’t Hamath like Arpad? Isn’t Samaria like Damascus? 
10:10 As my hand has reached the kingdoms of the idols—with more graven images than Jerusalem and Samaria— 
10:11 as I’ve done to Samaria and her idols, won’t I also do to Jerusalem and her idols?” 
10:12 Therefore it will come to pass, when </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:13 For he said: “By the strength of my own hand I’ve done it, and my own wisdom, for I am shrewd! I abolished the borders of peoples, and plundered their treasures. As a mighty one I cast down inhabitants. 
10:14 My hand found the riches of the peoples as a nest—like gathering forsaken eggs, I have gathered the entire earth. Not a wing fluttered, not a beak opened or chirped!” 
10:15 Should the axe boast against the One who chops with it? Should the saw magnify itself against the One who wields it? It would be like a rod waving the One who lifts it, or like a staff hoisting up the One who is not wood! 
10:16 Therefore will the Lord </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:17 So the light of Israel will become a fire, and its Holy One a flame. He will burn and consume its thorns and briers in one day. 
10:18 Both the glory of his forest and his fruitful field, he will consume, both soul and body. It will be like a sick man wasting away. 
10:19 The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few, a child could record them.
10:20 Yet it will come about in that day that the remnant of Israel— those of the house of Jacob who escaped— will never again depend on the one who struck them down, but will depend upon </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:21 A remnant will return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the Mighty God. 
10:22 For though your people, O Israel, be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. Destruction has been decreed. Justice overflows. 
10:23 For a complete destruction, as decreed, will </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:24 Therefore thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:25 “For in a very little while My indignation against you will be spent, and My anger will turn to their destruction.” 
10:26  will stir up against him a scourge, as in the slaughter of Midian at the Rock of Oreb. As His staff was over the sea, so will He lift it up, as He did in Egypt. 
10:27 In that day his burden will be taken off your shoulders, and his yoke off your neck. Indeed, the yoke will be broken because of fatness. 
10:28 He has come to Aiath, and passed through Migron. At Michmas he deposited his supplies. 
10:29 They have crossed over the pass. They have taken up lodging at Geba. Ramah is terrified; Gibeath-shaul has fled. 
10:30 Shriek your cry, daughter of Gallim! Listen, O Laish! O poor Anathoth! 
10:31 Madmenah has fled. The inhabitants of Gebim take cover. 
10:32 This very day he will halt at Nob. He shakes his fist at the mountain of the Daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. 
10:33 Behold, the Lord, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:34 Yes, He will hack down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon with its majesty will fall. 
11:1 Then a shoot will come forth out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch will bear fruit out of His roots. 
11:2 The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
11:3 His delight will be in the fear of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:4 But with righteousness He will judge the poor, and decide with fairness for the poor of the land. He will strike the land with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked. 
11:5 Also righteousness will be the belt around His loins, and faithfulness the belt around His waist.
11:6 The wolf will dwell with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the kid, the calf and the young lion and the yearling together, and a little child will lead them. 
11:7 The cow and the bear will graze, their young ones lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like an ox. 
11:8 A nursing child will play by a cobra’s hole, and a weaned child will put his hand into a viper’s den. 
11:9 They will not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:10 It will also come about in that day that the root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples. The nations will seek for Him, and His resting place will be glorious. 
11:11 It will also come about in that day that my Lord will again redeem— a second time with His hand— the remnant of His people who remain from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. 
11:12 He will lift up a banner for the nations, and assemble the dispersed of Israel, and gather the scattered of Judah from the four corners of the earth. 
11:13 Ephraim’s envy will end, those hostile to Judah will be cut off. Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah, and Judah will not harass Ephraim. 
11:14 They will swoop down on the Philistine slope to the west. Together they will plunder the children of the east— laying their hand on Edom and Moab, the children of Ammon obeying them. 
11:15 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:16 So there will be a highway for the remnant of His people who remain, from Assyria, as there was for Israel in the day they came up out of the land of Egypt.
12:1 In that day you will say: “I will give You thanks, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:2 Behold, God is my salvation! I will trust and will not be afraid. For the Lord </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:3 With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation. 
12:4 In that day you will say: “Give thanks to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:5 Sing to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:6 Cry out and shout, inhabitant of Zion! For great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.”
13:1 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw: 
13:2 Lift up a banner on a bare mountain, raise a voice to them, wave a hand, so that they may enter the gates of the nobles. 
13:3 I have commanded My consecrated ones, yes, I have called My mighty ones, My proud exulting ones, for My fury. 
13:4 A sound of tumult in the mountains like that of many people! A sound of uproar of kingdoms, of nations gathered! </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:5 They are coming from a far country— from the end of the heavens— </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:6 Wail, for the day of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:7 Therefore all hands will fall limp, and every man’s heart will melt. 
13:8 They will be terrified; pain and anguish will take hold of them; they will writhe as a woman in labor; they will look aghast at one another— their faces aflame! 
13:9 Behold, the day of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:10 For the stars of heaven and their constellations will not give their light. The rising sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. 
13:11 I will punish the world for evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. I will put an end to the arrogance of the proud, and abase the insolence of tyrants. 
13:12 I will make people scarcer than gold, even than the pure gold of Ophir. 
13:13 Therefore I will make heaven tremble, and the earth will shake from its place at the wrath of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:14 It will be like a hunted gazelle, or like sheep with no one gathering. Each will return to his own people, each will flee to his own country. 
13:15 Everyone found will be thrust through. Everyone caught will fall by the sword. 
13:16 Their babes will be dashed in pieces before their eyes. Their houses will be plundered, and their wives ravished. 
13:17 Behold, I will stir up against them the Medes, who will not value silver and will take no delight in gold. 
13:18 Their bows will cut down the young men, with no pity on the fruit of the womb, nor will their eye spare children. 
13:19 So Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of Chaldean pride, will be just as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 
13:20 It will never be inhabited, nor will it be dwelt in from generation to generation, nor will an Arab pitch a tent there, nor will shepherds let flocks lie there. 
13:21 But desert creatures will lie there. Their houses will be full of owls. Ostriches will dwell there, and goat-demons will dance there. 
13:22 Hyenas will howl in their citadels and jackals in their pleasant palaces. Her time is near to come— her days will not drag on long. 
14:1 For </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:2 The peoples will take them and escort them to their place. The house of Israel will possess them in the land of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:3 Now in the day when </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:4 you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon and say: “How the taskmaster has ceased! The raging oppressor, exacter of gold, has ceased! 
14:5  has broken the rod of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers, 
14:6 which struck the people in wrath with continual strokes, which ruled the nations in fury, with relentless persecution. 
14:7 The whole earth is at rest, and quiet. They break forth with a ringing cry! 
14:8 Even the cypress trees rejoice over you, along with the cedars of Lebanon: “Since you were laid low, no woodcutter comes up against us.” 
14:9  from below is excited about you, to meet you at your coming! He stirs up the dead spirits for you, even the chief ones of the earth. He makes all the kings of the nations rise up from their thrones. 
14:10 They all answer and say to you: “Even you have become as weak as us? Have you become like us? 
14:11 Your pomp is brought down to </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Sheol
14:12 How you have fallen from heaven, O brightstar, son of the dawn! How you are cut down to the earth, you who made the nations prostrate! 
14:13 You said in your heart: “I will ascend to heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit upon the mount of meeting, in the uttermost parts of the north. 
14:14 I will ascend above the high places of the clouds— I will make myself like Elyon.” 
14:15 Yet you will be brought down to </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Sheol
14:16 Those who see you will stare at you, reflecting on what has become of you: “Is this the one who shook the earth, who made kingdoms tremble, 
14:17 who made the world a wilderness and destroyed its cities, who never opened the house of his prisoners?” 
14:18 All the kings of the nations, all of them, lie in glory, each in his own house. 
14:19 But you are cast out of your tomb as a discarded branch, garment of the slain, pierced with a sword, dumped into a stony pit, a corpse trodden underfoot. 
14:20 You will not join with them in burial, because you ruined your land, you slaughtered your own people. The offspring of evildoers will never be named. 
14:21 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers, so they would not rise up and possess the land, or fill the face of the earth with cities. 
14:22 “For I will rise up against them”—it is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:23 “I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, with marshes of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction.” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:24  has sworn, saying: “Surely, as I thought it, so it will be. As I have purposed, so it will stand. 
14:25 I will break Assyria in My land. On My mountains I will trample him. Then his yoke will be taken off them, his burden removed from their shoulder. 
14:26 This is the purpose planned for the whole earth, and this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.” 
14:27 For </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:28 In the year king Ahaz died came this burden: 
14:29 Do not rejoice, all you of Philistia, that the rod that struck you is broken. For from the serpent’s root comes a viper and its fruit will be a flying serpent. 
14:30 The firstborn of the poor will feed, and the needy will lie down in safety. I will kill your root with famine, and your survivors will be slain. 
14:31 Wail, O gate! Cry, O city! Melt away, all you of Philistia! For smoke is coming from the north, and there is no straggler in its ranks. 
14:32 What will they answer the messengers of the nation? For </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:1 The burden of Moab. For in the night that Ar is devastated, Moab is ruined; for in the night that Kir is devastated, Moab is ruined. 
15:2 He has gone up to the shrine, to Dibon, to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba. Every head is bald, every beard shaven. 
15:3 In their streets they wear sackcloth. On their housetops and in their plazas, everyone wails, weeping profusely. 
15:4 Heshbon and Elealeh cry out. Their voice is heard as far as Jahaz. Therefore the soldiers of Moab cry aloud, his soul faints within him. 
15:5 My heart cries out for Moab. Her fugitives are as far as Zoar as a three year old heifer, for by the ascent of Luhith they go up with weeping, for on the way of Horonaim they raise a cry of distress. 
15:6 The waters of Nimrim are desolate. The grass is withered away, the new grass withers, there is nothing green. 
15:7 Therefore the riches they had gotten and whatever they have stored, they carry over the Wadi of Willows. 
15:8 For the cry has gone around the borders of Moab, the wailing to Eglaim, and the wailing to Beer-elim. 
15:9 For the waters of Dimon are full of blood, but I will bring on Dimon even more— a lion for those escaping from Moab, and for those remaining in the land.
16:1 Send lambs to the ruler of the land from Sela in the desert to the mountain of the Daughter of Zion. 
16:2 For like fluttering birds, scattered from a nest, so will the daughters of Moab be at the fords of Arnon. 
16:3 ‘Give counsel, execute justice. Cast your shadow like night at noonday. Hide the refugees, do not betray the fugitive. 
16:4 Let My refugees stay with you. Be for Moab a hiding place from the face of the destroyer. For the extortion is at an end, devastation ceases, oppressors are gone from the land. 
16:5 A throne will be established in mercy, and One will sit on it in truth —in the tent of David— One who seeks justice and is ready for righteousness. 
16:6 We have heard of the pride of Moab— very proud is he—of his haughtiness, his arrogance, his insolence, and his dishonest boasting. 
16:7 Therefore Moab will wail for Moab— everyone will wail! For the sweet cakes of Kir-hareseth you will moan, utterly stricken. 
16:8 For the fields of Heshbon have withered, as well as the vine of Sibmah. Rulers of nations have trampled the choice clusters, that reached as far as Jazer and into the desert, its branches spread out and crossed to the sea. 
16:9 Therefore I will weep bitterly for Jazer, for the vine of Sibmah. I will drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh. For on your summer and your harvest the battle cry has fallen. 
16:10 Gladness and joy are taken away from the fruitful field. In the vineyards, no singing for joy no happy shouting, no treading wine in the presses. I have made the shouting stop. 
16:11 Therefore my heart moans for Moab like a lyre, and my inward part for Kir-heres. 
16:12 So it will be, when Moab is weary upon the high place and comes to his sanctuary to pray, it will do him no good. 
16:13 This is the word that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

17:1 The burden of Damascus: Behold, Damascus will cease as a city and will become a ruinous heap. 
17:2 The cities of Aroer are forsaken. They will be for flocks—they will lie down and no one will frighten them. 
17:3 The fortress will also cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus. The remnant of Aram will be like the glory of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
17:4 Now in that day Jacob’s glory will fade, and the fatness of his flesh grow lean. 
17:5 It will be as when the harvester gathers the standing grain and reaps the heads with his arm, as when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim. 
17:6 Only gleanings will remain, as when beating an olive tree— two or three olives at the very top, four or five on a fruitful tree’s branches. It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:7 In that day a man will look to his Maker and his eyes will turn to the Holy One of Israel. 
17:8 He will not look to the altars, the work of his hands, nor will he look to what his fingers have made—neither the Asherah poles nor the sun-images. 
17:9 In that day the strong cities will be like forsaken forests and treetops that were abandoned, because of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
17:10 For you have forgotten the God of your salvation and you have not remembered the Rock of your strength. Therefore you plant delightful plants and set out exotic vines. 
17:11 In the day that you plant, you fence it in, and in the morning you made your seed to sprout— but the harvest will be a heap in a day of grief and incurable pain. 
17:12  ! The uproar of many peoples who roar like the roaring of the seas. The rumbling of nations, who rush in like the rumbling of mighty waters! 
17:13 The nations will rush in like the rumbling of many waters, but He will rebuke them so they will flee far away, chased like chaff on the hills before the wind, like whirling dust before the storm. 
17:14 At evening time—sudden terror! Before morning, they are no more. This is the reward of those who plunder us and the lot of those who pillage us. 
18:1  ! The land of whirring wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, 
18:2 that sends ambassadors by sea, in papyrus vessels upon the water. Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth-skinned, to a people feared far and wide, a nation powerful and oppressive, whose land the rivers divide. 
18:3 All you inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on earth, when a banner is raised on the mountains, look! when a </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shofar

18:5 For before the harvest, as soon as blossoming is over and flower becomes ripening grape, He will cut off the shoots with pruning knives, He will cut back and remove the twigs. 
18:6 They will be left together for the mountain birds of prey and the beasts of the land. The birds of prey will summer on them, and all the beasts of the land will winter upon them. 
18:7 At that time tribute will be brought to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:1 The burden of Egypt: Behold, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:2 I will stir up Egyptian against Egyptian. Everyone will fight against his brother, and everyone against his neighbor— city against city, kingdom against kingdom. 
19:3 The spirit of Egypt will drain within it, and I will confuse its counsel. So they will resort to idols, charmers, mediums and familiar spirits. 
19:4 I will give the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel master—a fierce king will rule over them. It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:5 The waters from the sea will dry up, and the river will be drained dry. 
19:6 Then the channels will stink. The streams of Egypt will dwindle and dry up. Reeds and rushes will rot. 
19:7 The bulrushes by the Nile, by the mouth of the Nile, and everything sown by the Nile will wither, blow away and be no more. 
19:8 Then the fishermen will lament. All who cast hooks in the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish. 
19:9 Moreover the workers of fine flax, and the weavers of white cloth will be ashamed. 
19:10 Her pillars will be crushed, All hired workers will be grieved in soul. 
19:11 The princes of Zoan are utter fools. Pharaoh’s wisest counselors are stupid. How can you say to Pharaoh, “I am the son of the wise, a son of ancient kings”? 
19:12 Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you now! Let them know what </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:13 The princes of Zoan are fools. the princes of Noph are deceived. The cornerstone of her tribes have led Egypt astray. 
19:14  has mixed within her a spirit of dizziness. They make Egypt stagger in every work, as a drunkard staggers in his vomit. 
19:15 There will be no work for Egypt to do, for head or tail, palm branch or rush. 
19:16 In that day Egypt will be like women trembling with fear, because of the shaking hand of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:17 The land of Judah will terrify Egypt. Anyone who mentions it will be afraid, because of what </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:18 In that day five cities in the land of Egypt will speak the language of Canaan, swearing allegiance to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:19 In that day there will be an altar to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:20 It will be as a sign and a witness to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

19:22 So </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:23 In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrians will come to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria, and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians. 
19:24 In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria—a blessing in the midst of the earth. 
19:25 For </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:1 In the year that the Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him and he fought against Ashdod and captured it,

20:3 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:4 so will the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, with their buttocks uncovered, to Egypt’s shame. 
20:5 So they will be dismayed and ashamed, because they hoped in Ethiopia and boasted in Egypt. 
20:6 Then the inhabitants of the coastland will say in that day, ‘Look, such is our hope—there we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria! Now, how will we escape?’”
21:1 The burden of the desert by the sea: As windstorms sweep over the South, so it comes from the desert, a terrifying land. 
21:2 A harsh vision has been shown to me: “The traitor betrays, and the plunderer plunders. Go up, Elam! Besiege, Media! I have put an end to all her groaning.” 
21:3 Therefore my body is filled with pain. Pangs have taken hold of me like the pangs of a woman in labor. I am bewildered by what I hear, terrified by what I see. 
21:4 My heart is bewildered, terror overwhelms me. The twilight I longed for has been turned into trembling. 
21:5 Set the table, spread out the cloth! Eat! Drink! “Rise up, you princes, oil the shield!”

21:9 Look! Here comes a chariot of men, with a pair of horsemen.” Then one answered and said, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon! All the images of her gods are broken on the ground.”

21:11 The burden of Dumah: One calls to me from Seir, “Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?” 
21:12 The watchman said, “Morning comes, yet also it is night.” If you would inquire, inquire. Come back again.” 
21:13 The burden of Arabia: In the desert brush of Arabia you will stay for the night, you caravans of Dedanites. 
21:14 To him who is thirsty bring water, inhabitants of the land of Tema, meet the fugitive with food. 
21:15 For they fled from swords, from drawn sword, from bent bow and distress of war. 
21:16 For thus </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

22:1 The burden of the Valley of Vision: What is the matter with you now? For you have gone up to the rooftops. 
22:2 You were full of noise, a boisterous city, an exultant town? Your dead were not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle. 
22:3 All your rulers have fled together, then captured without a bow. All who were caught were taken into exile together, though they had fled far off. 
22:4 Therefore I said, “Look away from me! Let me weep bitterly— don’t try to comfort me about the ruin of the daughter of my people.” 
22:5 For my Lord </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:6 Elam took up the quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield. 
22:7 So it will come to pass that your choicest valleys will be full of chariots and horsemen posted at the gate. 
22:8 So He will expose Judah’s defense, and in that day you will look for the armor in the Forest House. 
22:9 Then you will see the breaches in the walls of the city of David—for they will be many—though you collect the water of the lower pool. 
22:10 Though you counted the houses of Jerusalem, you broke down the houses to fortify the wall. 
22:11 You even made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool—but you did not look to the Maker, or consider the One who planned it long before. 
22:12 Now in that day, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:13 But instead, there is joy and gladness, slaughtering cattle and killing sheep, meat and drinking wine! “Let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die!” 
22:14 But </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:15 Thus says my Lord </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:16 ‘What are you doing here, and who are you to be here, that you cut out a grave for yourself, carving out a tomb on the height, chiseling a crypt for yourself in the rock? 
22:17 Behold, strong man, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:18 He will roll you up tightly and toss you like a ball into a large country. There you will die, and your glorious chariots will be the shame of your Master’s house. 
22:19 I will remove you from your post, and pull you down from your station. 
22:20 “In that day I will summon my servant Eliakim, son of Hilkiah. 
22:21 I will clothe him in your robe and fasten your sash on him. I will give your authority into his hands, so he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. 
22:22 I will set the key of the house of David upon his shoulder—what he opens, no one can shut; what he shuts, and no one can open. 
22:23 I will fasten him as a peg in a firm place, and he will be a throne of honor to his father’s house. 
22:24 They will hang all the glory of his father’s house on him—offspring and posterity, all the small vessels, from bowls to all the jars. 
22:25 “In that day,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:1 The burden of Tyre. Wail, ships of Tarshish! For Tyre is destroyed. There is no house and no harbor. From the land of Cyprus, it was revealed to them. 
23:2 Be still, inhabitants of the coastland, you merchants of Sidon, your messengers crossing the sea. 
23:3 On many waters the grain of Shihor, the harvest of the Nile was her revenue and a marketplace of nations. 
23:4 Be ashamed, O Sidon. For the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, “I have not writhed or given birth. I have not reared young men or brought up maidens.” 
23:5 When the report reaches Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report about Tyre. 
23:6 Cross over to Tarshish. Wail, you inhabitants of the island! 
23:7 Is this your jubilant city? Whose antiquity is from long ago, whose feet have taken her to settle in far off lands? 
23:8 Who planned this against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants were princes, whose traders were the honored of earth? 
23:9  has planned it, to defile the pride of all glory, to shame all the honored of earth. 
23:10 Overflow through your land like the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish! There is no restraint any more. 
23:11 His hand has stretched out over the sea, He has shaken the kingdoms. </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:12 He said, “You will exult no more.” O crushed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, cross over to Cyprus— even there you will have no rest. 
23:13 Look, the land of the Chaldeans— this is the people who no longer exist. Assyria set it up for desert animals. They set up their siege towers; they stripped its palaces; they made it a ruin. 
23:14 Wail, you ships of Tarshish! For your stronghold is destroyed. 
23:15 Then it will come about in that day that Tyre will be forgotten for 70 years, like the days of one king. At the end of 70 years it will happen to Tyre just as in the song of the prostitute: 
23:16 “Take a harp, stroll about the city, forgotten harlot! Skillfully play many songs, so you may be remembered.” 
23:17 Then it will come about after the end of 70 years that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

24:5 The land is polluted by its inhabitants, for they have transgressed </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
24:6 Therefore a curse will devour the land. Those dwelling there are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the land will be burned up, so the people remaining are few. 
24:7 The new wine fails, the vine wilts, all the merry-hearted sigh. 
24:8 The glee of tambourines stops, the noise of revelers ends, the joy of the harp ceases. 
24:9 They no longer drink wine with song. Liquor is bitter to those drinking it. 
24:10 The shattered city is in chaos. Every house is shut up, none may enter. 
24:11 In the streets is an outcry for wine; all joy becomes dark as evening; the mirth of the land is banished. 
24:12 The city is left in ruins; the gate is battered down.
24:13 So will it be in the earth and among the nations, as when shaking an olive tree, or as when gleanings are left after the grape harvest. 
24:14 They will raise their voices, They will sing for joy, of the majesty of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:15 ‘Therefore glorify </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

24:17 Panic, pit and trap are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth. 
24:18 And it shall come to pass: whoever flees from the sound of panic will fall in the pit, and whoever climbs up out of the pit will be caught in the trap. For the windows of heaven are opened and the foundations of the earth shake. 
24:19 The earth is broken apart, the earth is split open, the earth is shaken utterly. 
24:20 The earth reels to and fro like a drunk, and sways like a hut. its transgression is so heavy upon it that it will fall and never rise again. 
24:21 It will come about in that day, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:22 They will be gathered together, like prisoners in the Pit, and will be shut up in the prison, and after many days be punished. 
24:23 Then the moon will be abashed and the sun ashamed, for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:1 , You are my God, I will exalt You, I will praise Your Name, for You have done wonderful things, plans of old with steadfast faithfulness. 
25:2 For You have made a city into a heap, a fortified city into a ruin, a foreigner’s palace a city no more— never to be rebuilt. 
25:3 Therefore a strong people will honor You. Cities of ruthless nations will fear You. 
25:4 For You have been a stronghold for the poor, a stronghold for the needy in distress, a refuge from the rainstorm, a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like a storm against the wall. 
25:5 Like heat in a dry place, You subdue the roar of foreigners. Like heat in the shade of a cloud, the song of tyrants is brought low. 
25:6 On this mountain, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:7 On this mountain He will swallow up the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the veil spread over all nations. 
25:8 He will swallow up death forever. my Lord </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:9 It will be said in that day: “Behold, this is our God, We waited for Him—He will save us. This is </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

25:11 When he spreads his hands in it as a swimmer spreads his hands to swim, his pride will be brought down low together with the trickery of his hands. 
25:12 He will level your high-fortified walls, lay them low, and cast them down to the ground, down to dust.
26:1 In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah: “We have a strong city. He appoints salvation as its walls and ramparts. 
26:2 Open the gates! Let the righteous nation enter— one that keeps faith. 
26:3 You keep in perfect peace one whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You. 
26:4 Trust in </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:5 For He humbles those dwelling on high, leveling the lofty city, leveling it to the ground, bringing it down to the dust. 
26:6 Feet will trample it down, feet of the afflicted, the footsteps of the poor. 
26:7 The way of the righteous is straight. Upright One, You make smooth the path of the righteous. 
26:8 Yes, in the way of Your judgments, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:9 My soul longs for You at night, yes, my spirit within me seeks You. For when Your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness. 
26:10 Though grace is shown to the wicked, he does not learn righteousness. Even in a land of uprightness he will act wrongly, not perceiving the majesty of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:11 , Your hand is lifted up, yet they do not see it; They will see Your zeal for the people and be put to shame. Yes, fire will devour Your enemies. 
26:12  for us, for all our works You have done for us. 
26:13 , other lords beside You have had dominion over us, but we remember Your Name alone. 
26:14 The dead do not live— dead souls do not rise. Thus You punished and destroyed them and wiped out all memory of them. 
26:15 You have increased the nation, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:16 , they sought You in distress, they poured out a whispered prayer when Your discipline was upon them. 
26:17 As a pregnant woman about to give birth writhes and cries out in her pain, so we were before You, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:18 We have been with child, we have been in pain, yet we gave birth to wind. We are accomplishing no deliverance for the earth, nor are inhabitants of the world coming to life. 
26:19 Yet it will be: “Your dead will live! My corpses will rise! Awake and shout for joy, you who dwell in the dust! Your dew is like the dew of the dawn. The land of dead souls will come to life! 
26:20 Go, my people, enter your rooms, and shut your doors behind you. Hide for a little while, until the wrath is past. 
26:21 For behold, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

27:2 “In that day sing to her, ‘A vineyard of delight!’ 
27:3 I, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
27:4 It is not that I have wrath. Who would give me thorns and thistles? Into battle I would march against them! I would burn them up altogether! 
27:5 Rather let them rely on My strength. Let them make peace with Me— make peace with Me.”
27:6 In days to come Jacob will take root, Israel will blossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruit. 
27:7 Did He strike Israel as He struck those who struck them? Or were they slain as their slayers were slain? 
27:8 You contended with her by banishing her, by driving her away. With His fierce wind He expelled them on the day of the east wind. 
27:9 So by this will Jacob’s sin be atoned and this the full price to remove his sin: When he makes all the altar stones like shattered chalk stones, so that the Asherah poles and incense rise no more. 
27:10 The fortified city is a lonely habitation, forlorn and forsaken like the desert. There the calf will graze, there lie down and consume its branches. 
27:11 When the boughs are withered, they will be broken off. Women come and set them on fire, for it is a people of no understanding. Therefore their Maker will show them no mercy—He who formed them will give them no grace. 
27:12 It will come about in that day, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

28:2 Behold, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:3 The proud crown of Ephraim’s drunks will be trampled underfoot. 
28:4 The glorious beauty is a fading flower which is at the head of the fertile valley, like a first-ripe fig before summer— whoever sees it, swallows it up while it is still in his palm. 
28:5 In that day </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:6 a spirit of judgment for him who sits on the judgment seat, and strength for those turning back the battle at the gate. 
28:7 But these also reel from wine and stagger from strong drink —the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
28:8 Since all the tables are full of the filth of vomit, no place is left. 
28:9 To whom will He teach knowledge? To whom will He explain the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just taken from the breast? 
28:10 For it must be ‘precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little.’ 
28:11 For through stammering lips and a foreign tongue He will speak to this people, 
28:12 To whom He said, “Here is rest, give rest to the weary, here is repose”— but they would not listen. 
28:13 So the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:14 Therefore hear the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:15 “Because you have said, ‘We cut a covenant with death, we made a pact with </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Sheol
28:16 Therefore thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:17 But I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line. Hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and water will overflow the hiding place. 
28:18 Your covenant with death is annulled, and your pact with </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Sheol
28:19  As often as it passes through, it will seize you—morning by morning, by day and by night passing through. It will be sheer terror to understand the message.’” 
28:20 For too short is the bed to stretch on, too narrow the blanket to wrap up in. 
28:21 For </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:22 So now, stop your scoffing, lest your shackles be strengthened! For I have heard from </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
28:23 Give ear and hear my voice! Pay attention and hear my words. 
28:24 Does a plowman plow all day to sow the seed? Does he continually break open and harrow his ground? 
28:25 No! When he has leveled its surface, he scatters dill and sows cumin, plants wheat in rows, places barley, and rye on its border. 
28:26 For his God teaches him judgment, instructing him. 
28:27 For dill is not threshed with a sledge, nor is a cart wheel rolled over cumin. Rather, dill is beaten out with a staff, and cumin with a rod. 
28:28 Bread grain is crushed, but not endlessly. Rumbling cart wheels and horses over it would only crush it to powder. 
28:29 This also comes from </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:1  , Ariel, Ariel! City where David camped. Year to year again—festivals in a cycle. 
29:2 But I will distress Ariel. There will be lamenting and moaning— then will she be like Ariel to Me? 
29:3 I will encamp against you all around, I will set up siege-works against you and will raise up ramps against you. 
29:4 You will be brought low, you will speak from the ground. From the dust where you are prostrate your speech will come. Your voice will be like a ghost out of the ground, and your speech will whisper out of the dust. 
29:5 Yet the multitude of your foes will become like fine dust, and the multitude of the terrifying like chaff that passes away. It will happen in an instant, suddenly. 
29:6 You will be visited by </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:7 It will be like a dream, a night vision: the multitude of all the nations warring against Ariel, yes, all warring against her, the ramparts around her and her besiegers. 
29:8 It will be like a hungry man dreaming and behold, he is eating, but awakes with his hunger unsatisfied, or like a thirsty man dreaming and behold, he is drinking, but awakes faint, his soul thirsting. So it will be with the multitude of all the nations warring against Mount Zion. 
29:9 Wait, and be astounded! Blind yourselves, and be blind! Drunk, but not with wine, Stagger, but not with strong drink. 
29:10 For </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:11 So this entire vision is for you like the words of a sealed scroll, which they give to one who knows books, saying, “Read this, please,” but he says, “I can’t, because it’s sealed.” 
29:12 Then the scroll is given to one who does not know books, saying, “Read this, please,” but he says, “I don’t know books.” 
29:13 So </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:14 Therefore, behold, once more I will do a marvelous work among this people— a marvel and a wonder— so the wisdom of their wise will perish, and the discernment of their discerning will be concealed.” 
29:15 ! Their works are in the dark. They say, “Who sees us? Who knows us?” 
29:16 Your perversity! Should the potter be regarded the same as the clay? Should the thing made say to its maker, “You did not make me”? Or the thing formed say of its former, “You have no understanding?” 
29:17 Will it not be just a very little while before Lebanon turns into a garden, and a garden will seem like a forest? 
29:18 In that day the deaf will hear words of a book, and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see. 
29:19 The meek will add to their joy in </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:20 For the ruthless will come to an end and the scorner will be finished, and all watching to do evil cut off. 
29:21 Those who make a man out to be guilty with a word, and trap him who reproves at the gate, and deny justice with meaninglessness. 
29:22 Therefore, thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:23 for when he sees his children, the work of My hands in his midst, they will sanctify My Name; they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and stand in awe of the God of Israel. 
29:24 Those who go astray in spirit will come to understanding, and those who murmur will learn instruction.”

30:2 who go down to Egypt, but did not consult Me, to take refuge in Pharaoh’s stronghold, to seek shelter in Egypt’s shadow. 
30:3 Therefore Pharaoh’s stronghold will become your shame, and the shelter in Egypt’s shadow will become your disgrace. 
30:4 For though their princes are at Zoan and their ambassadors reach Hanes, 
30:5 they will all be ashamed of a people who cannot profit them. They are neither help nor profit, but shame and disgrace.” 
30:6 The burden concerning the beasts of the Negev: Through a land of trouble and anguish, in which are lioness and lion, viper and flying serpent, they are carrying their riches on the backs of young donkeys, their treasures on camel humps, to a people who cannot profit them. 
30:7 Egypt’s help is futile and pointless. Therefore I have called her “Rahab who just sits.” 
30:8 Now go, write it on a tablet for them and inscribe it in a scroll, so that it may be as a witness for the last day, forever. 
30:9 For this is a rebellious people, lying children, children unwilling to obey the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
30:10 They say to the seers, “Do not see,” and to the prophets, “Do not prophesy to us what is right. Speak to us smooth words. Prophesy illusions. 
30:11 Get out of the way! Turn away from the path! Let’s hear no more about the Holy One of Israel.” 
30:12 Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel: “Because you despise this word, and trust in oppression and rely on perversity, 
30:13 therefore this sin will be to you like a crack bulging in a high wall, about to fall— its collapse comes suddenly, in an instant! 
30:14 Its collapse is like smashing a clay jar, so ruthlessly shattered that a shard will not be found among the pieces to take fire from the hearth or scoop water from the cistern.”
30:15 For thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:16 But you said, “No, we will flee on horses!” Therefore you will flee. And, “We will ride on swift horses!” Therefore your pursuers will be swift. 
30:17 A thousand will flee at the threat of one, at the threat of five you will flee, until you are left like a flag on the top of a mountain, and like a banner on a hill. 
30:18 Therefore </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:19 For the people of Zion who are dwelling in Jerusalem will weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry. When He hears you, He will answer. 
30:20 Though </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:21 Your ears will hear a word behind you saying: “This is the way, walk in it. When you turn to the right, or when you turn to the left.” 
30:22 You will defile your graven images overlaid with silver, and your metal images covered with gold. You will throw them away like a menstrual cloth. You will say, “Be gone!” 
30:23 Then He will give you rain for your seed, which you will sow in the ground, and bread, the produce of the ground, will be rich and plentiful. In that day your cattle will feed in wide-open pasture. 
30:24 The oxen and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat seasoned fodder, which has been winnowed with shovel and pitchfork. 
30:25 There will be, on every high mountain and on every lofty hill, streams running with water— on a day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. 
30:26 Moreover the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter— like the light of seven days— in the day </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

30:28 His </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach

30:30  will make His glorious voice heard, and reveal His arm descending with fierce fury in a consuming fire, in cloudburst, rainstorm and hailstones.

30:32 Every stroke of His punishing rod that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

31:1 ! 
31:2 Yet He is also wise. He brings disaster, and does not take back His words. He rises against the house of evildoers, against help for workers of iniquity. 
31:3 Now Egyptians are men and not God, and their horses are flesh, not spirit. When </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

31:8 “Then Assyria will fall, not by a sword of man, so a sword not of man will devour him and he will flee from the sword. His young men will be put to forced labor. 
31:9  His rock will pass away because of fear. His princes will be afraid of the banner” —it is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
32:1 Behold, a king will reign in righteousness and princes will rule in justice. 
32:2 Each will be like a refuge from the wind and a shelter from the storm, like streams of water in a dry place, like the shade of a massive rock in a weary land. 
32:3 Then the eyes of those who see will not be closed, and the ears of those who hear will pay attention. 
32:4 The heart of the hasty will understand knowledge, and the tongue of stammerers will speak fluently, clearly. 
32:5 No longer will a fool be called noble, or a scoundrel said to be a gentleman. 
32:6 For the fool speaks foolishness and his heart works wickedness, to practice ungodliness, and speak error about </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
32:7 The scoundrel’s methods are evil— he makes up wicked schemes to destroy the poor with lies, even when the plea of the needy is just. 
32:8 But the noble devises noble plans, and for noble causes he stands. 
32:9 Rise up, you women at ease, And hear my voice. You complacent daughters, give ear to my words. 
32:10 Within a year and a few days you will shudder, complacent ones. For the grape harvest will fail and the gathering will not come. 
32:11 Tremble, you women at ease! Shudder, you complacent ones! Strip and make yourselves bare, and put sackcloth on your waist. 
32:12 Beat your breasts lamenting for pleasant fields, for fruitful vine, 
32:13 for the land of my people, where thorns and briars come up, for all the joyful houses of the jubilant city. 
32:14 For the palace will be abandoned; the bustling city will be deserted; the citadel and watchtower will become a wasteland forever, a delight of wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks, 
32:15 until the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
32:16 Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness abide in the garden. 
32:17 The result of righteousness will be </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom
32:18 My people will live in a peaceful place, in secure dwellings, quiet resting places. 
32:19 Then hail will flatten the forest; and the city will be utterly laid low. 
32:20 Blessed are you, sowing by all waters, letting the feet of the ox and the donkey range free.
33:1  , you destroyer, never destroyed, you traitor, never betrayed! When you have stopped destroying, you will be destroyed; and when you finish betraying, they will betray you. 
33:2 , be gracious to us! We long for You. Be our strength every morning, our salvation in time of trouble. 
33:3 From the noise of tumult people will flee; When You lift Yourself up, the nations will be scattered. 
33:4 Your spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathers; like a swarm of locusts, they are rushing over it. 
33:5  is exalted, for He dwells on high! He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness. 
33:6 It will be your time of faithfulness, a wealth of salvation, wisdom and knowledge— the fear of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:7 Behold, heroes cry outside. Ambassadors of peace weep bitterly. 
33:8 Highways are desolate; travel has ceased; covenant is broken; cities are despised; there is no regard for humanity. 
33:9 The land mourns and languishes; Lebanon is shamed and withers; Sharon is like a wilderness; Bashan and Carmel are shaken bare.
33:10 “Now I will arise,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:11 You conceive chaff, you will give birth to stubble. My breath is a fire that will consume you. 
33:12 Then peoples will be burned as lime, like thorns cut down, burned in the fire. 
33:13 Hear, you who are afar off, what I have done, and you who are near, acknowledge My might.” 
33:14 Sinners in Zion are afraid. Trembling has seized the godless: “Who among us can live with the consuming fire?” “Who among us can live with everlasting burnings?” 
33:15 One who walks righteously, and speaks uprightly, who refuses unjust gain by extortion, who shakes his hands free of bribes, who stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed, and shuts his eyes from looking on evil. 
33:16 He will dwell on the heights— his refuge will be an impregnable cliff. His bread will be provided, his water assured. 
33:17 Your eyes will see the King in His beauty. They will gaze at a far-distant land. 
33:18 Your heart will meditate on terror: “Where is the counter?” “Where is the weigher?” “Where is the counter of towers?” 
33:19 You will no longer see the fierce people, the people of speech too obscure to comprehend, with a stammering tongue no one understands. 
33:20 Look upon Zion, city of our Festivals. Your eyes will see Jerusalem as a quiet home, a tent that will never be folded, Its stakes never pulled up, its cords never broken. 
33:21 For there the majestic One, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:22 For </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:23 Your cords hang slack, not holding the mast in place firmly, nor spreading out the sail. Then abundant spoil will be divided— even the lame will carry off plunder. 
33:24 No inhabitant will say, “I am sick.” The people dwelling there will be forgiven their iniquity.
34:1 Draw near, O nations, to hear, and listen, O peoples! Let the earth hear, and all it contains, the world, and all its offspring! 
34:2 For </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:3 So their slain will be thrown out, and the stench of their corpses will rise, and the hills will be drenched with their blood. 
34:4 Then all the host of heaven will dissolve, and the skies will be rolled up like a scroll— so all their array will wither away, like a leaf drooping from a vine, like a fig shriveling from a fig tree.
34:5 For My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens. See, it will come down upon Edom, upon the people I have devoted to judgment. 
34:6 The sword of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:7 Wild oxen will go down with them, bull calves with mighty steers. So their land will be soaked with blood and their dust greasy with fat.

34:9 Its streams will be turned into pitch, its dust into brimstone, and its land will become burning tar. 
34:10 It will not be quenched night or day. Its smoke will go up forever. From generation to generation it will lay waste—forever and ever none will pass through it. 
34:11 But pelican and porcupine will have it, owl and raven will dwell in it. He will stretch a line of chaos over it and stones of desolation. 
34:12 As for its nobles, there are none there to call it a kingdom, and all its princes will come to nothing. 
34:13 Thorns will come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in its fortresses. It will be a haunt of jackals, an abode for ostriches. 
34:14 Wildcats will meet with wolves, the goat-demon will cry to its kind— yes, the night monster will settle there and find itself a resting place. 
34:15 A tree snake will nest and lay eggs there, hatch and gather them under its shadow. Surely, hawks are gathered there, each one with her mate. 
34:16 Seek from the scroll of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:17 He cast the lot for them, and His hand divided it out to them with the line. They will possess it forever, and dwell in it from generation to generation. 
35:1 The wilderness and dry land will be glad. The desert will rejoice and blossom like a lily. 
35:2 It will blossom profusely, will rejoice with joy and singing, will be given the glory of Lebanon, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
35:3 Strengthen the limp hands, make firm the wobbly knees. 
35:4 Say to those with anxious heart, “Be strong, have no fear!” Behold, your God! Vengeance is coming! God’s recompense—it is coming! Then He will save you. 
35:5 Then the eyes of the blind will be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped. 
35:6 Then the lame will leap like a deer, and the tongue of the mute will sing. For water will burst forth in the desert and streams in the wilderness. 
35:7 The parched land will become a pool, the thirsty ground springs of water. In the haunt of jackals, where they rest, grass will become reeds and rushes. 
35:8 A highway will be there—a roadway. It will be called the Way of Holiness. The unclean will not travel on it. It is for the one who walks the way. Fools will not go astray. 
35:9 No lion will be there. No ravenous beast will go up on it. They will not be found there. But the redeemed will walk there.

36:1 Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah that King Sennacherib of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. 
36:2 The king of Assyria sent the Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a massive army. The Rab-shakeh stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool in the highway of the washer’s field. 
36:3 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder came out to him. 
36:4 So the Rab-shakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: ‘What is this confidence you’ve relied on? 
36:5 I say your strategy and strength for war are only words of a lip. Who do you rely on now, so that you have rebelled against me? 
36:6 Behold, you rely on this splintered reed as a staff—Egypt! If a man leans on it, it will go into the palm of his hand and pierce it—thus Pharaoh king of Egypt is to all who trust in him. 
36:7 “‘But if you say to me: ‘We trust in </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
36:8 “So now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria. I’ll give you 2,ooo horses—if you could put riders of your own on them. 
36:9 So, how can you repulse a single lieutenant—the least of my master’s servants? Yes, you’re relying on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen. 
36:10 “Moreover, have I now come up against this land to destroy it without </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
36:11 Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to the Rab-shakeh: “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don’t speak to us in the language of the Jews when the people on the wall are listening.” 
36:12 But the Rab-shakeh said: “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words? Hasn’t he sent me to the men who sit on the wall—who will eat their own waste and drink their own urine with you?” 
36:13 Then the Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the language of the Jews and said: “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
36:14 Thus says the king: ‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you! 
36:15 Nor let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
36:16 “Don’t listen to Hezekiah! For thus says the king of Assyria: ‘Make peace with me and come out to me. Then everyone will eat from his own vine and fig tree, and everyone will drink water from his own cistern, 
36:17 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land—a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.’ 
36:18 “Beware that Hezekiah does not mislead you by saying, ‘</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
36:19 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Indeed, when did they deliver Samaria from my hand?

36:21 But they were silent, and did not answer him a word, for the king’s commandment was, “Do not answer him.” 
36:22 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rab-shakeh. 
37:1 When King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
37:2 Then he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the scribe and the senior </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
37:3 Then they said to him: “Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day of distress, rebuke and contempt. For children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength for giving birth. 
37:4 Perhaps </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
37:5 When the officials of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah, 
37:6 Isaiah said to them: “Thus you will say to your master, ‘Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
37:7 Behold, I am putting a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor, and will return to his own country; then I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.’” 
37:8 Then the Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard he had withdrawn from Lachish. 
37:9 Now he had heard them say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, saying: “He has come out to fight against you.” When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah saying: 
37:10 “Thus you will say to King Hezekiah of Judah, saying, do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying: ‘Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’ 
37:11 Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands—utterly destroying them—so will you be delivered? 
37:12 Have the gods of the nations delivered those my fathers destroyed—Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, or the children of Eden who were in Telassar? 
37:13 Where is the king of Hamath, or the king of Arpad, or the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, or Ivvah?’” 
37:14 Then Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
37:15 Hezekiah prayed to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
37:16 “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
37:17 Incline Your ear, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
37:18 It is true, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
37:19 and have cast their gods into the fire—for they were not gods, but the work of human hands, wood and stone. So they have destroyed them. 
37:20 Now, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
37:21 Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent word to Hezekiah saying, “Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
37:22 this is the word that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
37:23 Whom did you taunt and blaspheme? Against whom did you raise your voice and haughtily lift up your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel! 
37:24 Through your servants, you have blasphemed my Lord and said: ‘With my many chariots I have climbed to the heights of the mountains, to the remotest parts of Lebanon! I cut down its tall cedars and choice cypress trees. I have gone to its farthest peak, its thickest forest. 
37:25 I dug and drank water, and with the sole of my feet, I dried up all the streams of Egypt.’ 
37:26 Have you not heard? I did it long ago! From ancient times I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass— that you should turn fortified cities into heaps of rubble. 
37:27 Their inhabitants are weak handed, shattered and ashamed. They are like the grass of the field and green herb, like grass on roofs, scorched before it is grown up. 
37:28 But I know your sitting down, your going out and your coming in, and your raging against Me. 
37:29 Because your raging against Me and your arrogance reached My ears, I will put My hook in your nose, and My bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way that you came.” 
37:30 So this shall be the sign to you: This year you will eat what grows by itself, in the second year what springs from that. But in the third year, you will sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. 
37:31 The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will take root downward and bear fruit upward. 
37:32 For from Jerusalem a remnant will go out, and survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

37:35 “For I will defend this city to save it, for My own sake, and for My servant David’s sake.” 
37:36 Then the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
37:37 So King Sennacherib of Assyria withdrew, and returned home, and stayed in Nineveh. 
37:38 It also came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of his god Nisroch, that his sons Adrammelech and Sarezer struck him down with the sword, and escaped into the land of Ararat. Then his son Esarhaddon became king in his place.
38:1 In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. So Isaiah the prophet son of Amoz came to him and said to him, “Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
38:2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
38:3 He said: “Please, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

38:8 Behold, I will cause the shadow on the stairs, which went down with the sun on the sundial of Ahaz, to turn back ten steps.” So the sun’s shadow went back ten steps on the sundial on which it had gone down. 
38:9 A writing of King Hezekiah of Judah, after his illness, when he recovered from his illness: 
38:10 I said: “In the prime of my life, I am to enter the gates of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Sheol
38:11 I said: “I will not see </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
38:12 Like a shepherd’s tent, my dwelling is pulled up and carried away from me. Like a weaver I rolled up my life. He cuts me off from the loom. From day until night You make my end. 
38:13 I stilled my soul till morning. Like a lion, He will break all my bones. From day till night You make my end. 
38:14 Like a swallow or a crane, I whisper, I moan like a dove. My eyes are weary, looking upward. </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
38:15 What should I say? For He has spoken to me— He Himself has done it! I will wander about all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.

38:20 .” 
38:21 Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs, and apply it to the boil, and he will live.” 
38:22 Hezekiah had said, “What is the sign that I will go up to the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
39:1 At that time Merodach-baladan, son of King Baladan of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered. 
39:2 Now Hezekiah was pleased with them, so he showed them his treasure house—the silver and the gold, the spices and the precious oil—and his whole armory, and everything that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them. 
39:3 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?” Hezekiah replied, “They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon.” 
39:4 Then he asked, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezekiah said, “They have seen everything in my house. There is nothing among my treasuries that I didn’t show them.” 
39:5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah: “Hear the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
39:6 ‘Behold, days are coming when everything in your house, which your fathers have stored up to this day, will be carried to Babylon—nothing will be left,’ says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
39:7 ‘Moreover, some of your descendants—who will issue from you, whom you will father—will be taken away and will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’” 
39:8 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

40:6 A voice is saying, “Cry out!” So I said, “What shall I cry out?” “All flesh is grass, and all its loveliness is like the flower of the field. 
40:7 The grass withers, the flower fades. For the breath of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
40:8 The grass withers, the flower fades. But the word of our God stands forever.” 
40:9 Get yourself up on a high mountain, you who bring good news to Zion! Lift up your voice with strength, you who bring good news to Jerusalem! Lift it up! Do not fear! Say to the cities of Judah: “Behold your God!” 
40:10 Look, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
40:11 Like a shepherd, He tends His flock. He gathers the lambs in His arms carries them in his bosom, and gently guides nursing ewes. 
40:12 Who has measured the waters in the palm of His hand, or measured out heaven with a span, or calculated the dust of the earth in a measure, or weighed the mountains in scales, or the hills in a balance? 
40:13 Who can fathom the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
40:14 With whom did He consult, and who instructed Him? Who taught Him in the path of justice or taught Him knowledge? Who informed Him about the way of understanding? 
40:15 Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and count as a speck of dust on the scales. Behold, the islands weigh as fine dust. 
40:16 Lebanon is not enough to burn, or its animals enough for a burnt offering. 
40:17 All the nations are as nothing before Him. By Him they are accounted null and void. 
40:18 To whom then will you liken God? To what likeness will you compare Him? 
40:19 To an idol? A craftsman casts it, a goldsmith overlays it with gold and fashions silver chains for it. 
40:20 One too poor for such an offering chooses wood that will not rot. He looks for a skilled craftsman to prepare him an idol that will not totter. 
40:21 Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told to you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth? 
40:22 He sits above the circle of the earth— its inhabitants are like grasshoppers— He stretches out the skies like a curtain, spreads them out like a tent to dwell in. 
40:23 He reduces princes to nothing. He makes the judges of the earth a confusion. 
40:24 Scarcely are they planted, scarcely are they sown, scarcely their stem takes root in the earth, when He blows on them and they wither, and a storm carries them off as stubble. 
40:25 “To whom then will you liken Me? Or who is My equal?” says the Holy One. 
40:26 Lift up your eyes on high, and see! Who created these? The One who brings out their host by number, the One who calls them all by name. Because of His great strength and vast power, not one is missing. 
40:27 Why do you say, O Jacob, and assert, O Israel, “My way is hidden from </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

41:3 He pursues them, passing on safely, by a path his feet had not traveled. 
41:4 Who has performed and done it? Calling forth the generations from the beginning, I, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
41:5 The coastlands have seen and fear. The ends of the earth tremble. They draw near and come. 
41:6 Each one helps his neighbor and says to his brother, “Be strong!” 
41:7 The craftsman encourages the smith, who smooths with the hammer, who strikes with the anvil, saying of the soldering, “It’s good!” as he fastens it with nails so that it will not totter.
41:8 “But you, Israel, My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, descendant of Abraham, My friend— 
41:9 I took hold of you from the ends of the earth, and called from its uttermost parts, and said to you, ‘You are My servant— I have chosen you, not rejected you. 
41:10 Fear not, for I am with you, be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you. Surely I will help you. I will uphold you with My righteous right hand. 
41:11 Behold, all who were angry at you will be ashamed and disgraced. Those who quarrel with you will be as nothing and perish. 
41:12 Though you will look for those who contended with you, you will not find them. Those who warred against you will be as nothing at all. 
41:13 For I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

41:19 I will plant in the wilderness the cedar and the acacia tree, the myrtle and the olive tree. I will set in the desert the cypress tree and the pine together with the box tree—

41:23 Declare the things coming afterward, so we may know that you are gods! Indeed, do good or do evil, so we may all see and be awestruck. 
41:24 Behold, you are nothing, and your work is null. Whoever chooses you is loathsome. 
41:25 “I have stirred up one from the north, and he has come. From the rising of the sun, He will call upon My Name. He will trample rulers as on mortar, like a potter treading clay.” 
41:26 Who told this from the beginning, so that we may know? Or from former times, so we may say, “He is right”? In fact, no one foretold it, In fact, no one announced it. In fact, no one heard Your words. 
41:27 First it was to Zion: “Behold, here they are!” And to Jerusalem: “I will give a herald of good news.” 
41:28 But when I look, there is no one. There is no counselor among them. When I ask them, they have no response. 
41:29 Indeed, they are all a delusion. Their works are null. Their molten images are wind and waste.

42:14 “I have held My peace a long time, I have been still and restrained Myself. Now like a woman in labor I groan, gasping and panting at once. 
42:15 I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their vegetation. I will turn the rivers into islands, and dry up the pools. 
42:16 I will bring the blind by a way they do not know. in paths they have not known, I will guide them. I will turn darkness before them to light and the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do, and I will not forsake them. 
42:17 They will be turned back, utterly put to shame— those trusting in idols, who say to molten images, ‘You are our gods.’

43:5 Do not fear, for I am with you. I will bring your offspring from the east and gather you from the west. 
43:6 I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’ and to the south, ‘Do not hold them back.’ Bring My sons from far and My daughters from the ends of the earth. 
43:7 Everyone who is called by My Name, whom I created for My glory. I formed him—yes, I made him!”
43:8 Bring out the people who are blind, yet have eyes, who are deaf, yet have ears. 
43:9 All the nations are gathered together, and the peoples are assembled. Who among them can declare this, and proclaim to us former things? Let them present their witnesses so they may be justified, or let them hear and say, “It’s true.”

43:20 The field animals honor Me —the jackals and the ostriches— because I give waters in the desert, rivers in the wilderness, to give drink to My chosen people, 
43:21 the people I formed for Myself, so they might declare My praise. 
43:22 Yet you have not called on Me, Jacob, for you have been weary of Me, Israel. 
43:23 You have not brought Me sheep for your burnt offerings; nor have you honored Me with your sacrifices. I did not compel you to serve offerings nor wearied you with incense. 
43:24 You have not spent money buying Me aromatic cane, nor have you satisfied Me with the fat of your sacrifices. Rather you burdened Me with your sins, wearied Me with your iniquities. 
43:25 I, I am the One who blots out your transgressions for My own sake, and will not remember your sins. 
43:26 Remind me, when we argue our case together—state your case, so you may be proved right. 
43:27 Your first father sinned, and your mediators rebelled against Me. 
43:28 So I profaned the Sanctuary officials, and gave Jacob over to destruction, and Israel to scorn.
44:1 “But now listen, Jacob My servant, Israel, whom I have chosen.” 
44:2 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
44:3 For I will pour water on the thirsty land and streams on the dry ground. I will pour My Spirit on your offspring, and My blessing on your descendants. 
44:4 They will spring up among the grass like willows by flowing streams. 
44:5 This one will say, ‘I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
44:6 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
44:7 Who is like Me? Let him proclaim and announce it! Let him arrange it in order for Me— as I established the ancient nation. Let them declare to them what is coming and future events. 
44:8 Do not dread or be afraid. Have I not told you and declared it long ago? So you are My witnesses! Is there any God beside Me? Is there any other Rock? I know of none.
44:9 Those who fashion idols are empty. Their precious things do not profit. Their witnesses do not see or know, so they will be put to shame. 
44:10 Who fashions a god or casts an idol for no profit? 
44:11 Behold, all his friends will be ashamed, for the craftsmen are only human. Let them all assemble. Let them stand up. Let them dread. Let them be put to shame together. 
44:12 The blacksmith takes a tool and works with it over the coals, fashioning it with hammers and working it with his strong arm. Yet when he is hungry, his strength fails. When he drinks no water, he gets tired. 
44:13 A carpenter stretches out a line; he marks it with a pencil; he shapes it with planes; he marks it with a compass; he shapes it like the figure of a man —like the beauty of a man— so that it may sit in a shrine. 
44:14 He chops down cedars for himself, or he takes a cypress or an oak. He lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest. He plants a pine and rain nourishes it. 
44:15 Then it is something for a man to burn. so he takes one of them and warms himself. He also makes a fire to bake bread. He also makes a god and worships it. He makes an idol and bows before it. 
44:16 He burns half of it in the fire. With this half, he eats meat. He roasts a roast and is satisfied. He also warms himself and says, “Ah! I am warm, I have seen the fire.” 
44:17 Yet with the rest he makes a god, his carved image. He falls down before it and worships. He even prays to it and says, “Deliver me, for you are my god!” 
44:18 They do not know or understand! For He smeared over their eyes, so they cannot see, and their hearts, so they cannot understand. 
44:19 No one reflects in his heart, with no knowledge or discernment to say, “I burned half of it in the fire and I also baked bread on its coals. I roasted meat and ate—and then I make the rest of it an abomination? Should I bow before a block of wood?” 
44:20 He is feeding on ashes. A deceived heart has led him astray, so he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, “Isn’t what is in my right hand a fraud?” 
44:21 Remember these things, Jacob, and Israel, for you are My servant. I formed you, you are My servant. Israel, you will not be forgotten by Me! 
44:22 I have blotted out your transgressions like a thick cloud and your sins like a mist. Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.” 
44:23 Sing, O heavens, for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
44:24 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
44:25 causing the omens of boasters to fail, making fools of diviners, turning wise men backward and making their knowledge foolish, 
44:26 while confirming the word of His servant, fulfilling the counsel of His messengers, saying of Jerusalem, “She will be lived in” and of the cities of Judah, “They will be built, and I will raise up their ruins,” 
44:27 while saying to the deep, “Be dry, I will dry up your rivers,” 
44:28 while saying of Cyrus, “He is My shepherd, and he shall fulfill all My purpose” while saying to Jerusalem, “You will be built” and to the Temple, “Your foundation will be laid.” 
45:1 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
45:2 I will go before you and make crooked places straight. I will shatter bronze doors and cut through iron bars. 
45:3 I will give you treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places, so you may know that I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
45:4 For the sake of Jacob My servant, and Israel My chosen one, I have also called you by name, I have given you a title of honor, though you have not known Me. 
45:5 I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
45:6 so they may know, from the rising to the setting of the sun, that there is no one besides Me. I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

45:9  , to one who quarrels with his Maker, like a pot among the pots of the earth! Shall the clay say to the potter, “What have you made?” Or does your work say, “It has no handles”? 
45:10  , to him who says to his father, “What have you begotten?” Or to a woman, “What have you born?” 
45:11 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
45:12 I made the earth and created man on it. My hands stretched out the heavens and I commanded all their host. 
45:13 “I stirred Cyrus up in righteousness and I will level all his roads. He will build My city and set My exiles free, with no price or bribe,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
45:14 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
45:15 Truly You are a God who hides Himself, O God of Israel, Savior! 
45:16 All of them will be ashamed, disgraced— idol-makers go in dishonor together.

45:18 For thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

45:20 “Assemble yourselves and come, draw near together, fugitives of the nations! Those who carry their wooden idols have no knowledge, praying to a god who cannot save.

45:22 Turn to Me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth. For I am God—there is no other. 
45:23 By Myself I have sworn— the word has gone forth from My mouth in righteousness, and is irrevocable: that to Me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear. 
45:24 They will say of Me, ‘Only in </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

46:1 Bel bows down; Nebo stoops over. Their idols are for beasts and cattle. The things you carry are borne as burdens on weary beasts. 
46:2 They stoop, they bow down together, they cannot save the burden, but themselves go into captivity. 
46:3 “Listen to Me, house of Jacob, all the remnant of the house of Israel, borne by Me from birth, carried from the womb. 
46:4 Even to your old age I will be the same, until you are gray I will carry you. I have done it; I will bear you; I will carry you; I will deliver you. 
46:5 To whom will you liken Me, or make Me equal or compare Me, that we should be alike? 
46:6 They lavish gold from a purse and weigh out silver on the scales. They hire a goldsmith so he makes a god. They bow down. Yes, they worship it. 
46:7 They lift it upon a shoulder and carry it. They set in its place and there it stands. It does not budge from its place. Even if one cry to it, it cannot answer, nor save anyone from his trouble.”
46:8 “Remember this, and be assured. Recall it to mind, you transgressors. 
46:9 Remember the former things of old: For I am God—there is no other. I am God, and there is none like Me— 
46:10 declaring the end from the beginning, from ancient time, what is yet to come, saying, “My purpose will stand, and I will accomplish all that I please.” 
46:11 From the east I am calling a bird of prey, a man for My purpose from a far country. Truly I have spoken; I will bring it to pass; I have planned it; surely I will do it. 
46:12 Listen to Me, you stubborn-hearted, who are far from righteousness: 
46:13 I bring My justice near, it is not far off. So My salvation will not delay. I put salvation in Zion, My glory in Israel.”
47:1 Come down and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon. Sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of the Chaldeans. For you will no more be called tender and delicate. 
47:2 Take the millstones and grind flour. Remove your veil, strip off the skirt, uncover the leg, cross the rivers. 
47:3 Your nakedness will be uncovered, and your shame will be exposed. I will take vengeance, and will spare no one. 
47:4 Our Redeemer, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
47:5 Sit in silence, go into darkness, daughter of the Chaldeans. For you will no more be called the mistress-queen of kingdoms. 
47:6 I was angry with My people. I profaned My heritage. I gave them into your hand, but you showed them no mercy. You made your yoke very heavy on the aged. 
47:7 You said, “Forever, I will be the eternal mistress-queen!” You did not lay these things to heart or remember their end. 
47:8 Now then, hear this, voluptuous one, dwelling securely, saying in your heart, “I am, and there is no one besides me! I will not sit as a widow, or know the loss of children,” 
47:9 These two things will come upon you in a moment, in one day— loss of children and widowhood— they will come upon you in full measure in spite of your many sorceries and your many spells. 
47:10 You felt secure in your wickedness, You said, “No one sees me.” Your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, so you have said in your heart, “I am—there is no one else beside me!” 
47:11 But calamity will come upon you. You won’t know how to charm it away. Disaster will fall on you, for which you cannot atone. Catastrophe you cannot foresee will suddenly come upon you. 
47:12 Stand fast in your enchantments and your many sorceries, which you have toiled over since your youth. Perhaps you will succeed? Perhaps you will cause terror? 
47:13 You are weary of your consultations. So many! So let the astrologers, star-gazers, predicting by new moons, stand up and save you from what will come upon you. 
47:14 Behold, they shall be as stubble. Fire will consume them. They cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame! It is not a coal for warming by or a fire to sit before! 
47:15 So much have they become to you, with whom you have toiled, trafficking with you from your youth, each wandering about his own way. No one will save you! 
48:1 Hear this, house of Jacob, who are called by the Name of Israel, who came from the wellspring of Judah, who swear by the Name of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
48:2 For they call themselves by the holy city, and lean on the God of Israel, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
48:3 “I foretold the former things long ago. They went forth from My mouth, and I caused them to be heard. Suddenly I acted, so they came about. 
48:4 For I know that you are obstinate, and your neck is iron sinew, and your forehead bronze. 
48:5 So I foretold it to you long ago. before it came about I made you hear, lest you should say, ‘My idol did them, my carved image, yes, my molded image commanded them.’ 
48:6 You have heard. See all of it. So will you not admit it? I proclaim to you new things from now on—hidden things that you have not known. 
48:7 They are created now, not long ago. Before today you had not heard them. So you will not say, ‘Sure, I knew them.’ 
48:8 You have not heard; you never knew; even from long ago your ear has not been open. For I knew that you are treacherous, and from birth were called a rebel. 
48:9 For My Name’s sake I defer My anger, for My praise I will restrain it for you— otherwise I would cut you off. 
48:10 Behold, I have refined you, though not as silver. I tested you in the furnace of affliction. 
48:11 For My own sake, for My own sake, I act. For how should I be profaned? I will not give My glory to another. 
48:12 Listen to Me, Jacob, Israel whom I called: I am He; I am the first; I am also the last. 
48:13 Surely My hand founded the earth, My right hand spread out the heavens. When I call to them, they stand together. 
48:14 Assemble, all of you, and listen! Who among them foretold these things? </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
48:15 I, I have spoken, yes I called him. I will bring him, so his ways will succeed. 
48:16 Draw near to Me, hear this: Since the beginning, I have not spoken in secret. From the time it existed, I was there. So now </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
48:17 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
48:18 If only you had listened to My commandments! then your peace would be like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea. 
48:19 Your seed would have been like sand, and your offspring like its grains. Their name would never be cut off or destroyed from before Me.” 
48:20 “Get out of Babylon, flee from Chaldea! With a shout of joy, proclaim this, send it out to the end of the earth, say: ‘</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
48:21 They did not thirst when He led them through the deserts. He caused the water to flow out of the rock for them. He split the rock also, and the waters gushed out.’”

49:3 He said to Me, “You are My servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.” 
49:4 But I said, “I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and futility. Yet surely the justice due to me is with </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
49:5 So now says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
49:6 So He says, “It is too trifling a thing that You should be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and restore the preserved ones of Israel. So I will give You as a light for the nations, that You should be My salvation to the end of the earth.” 
49:7 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
49:8 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
49:9 saying to the prisoners, ‘Come out!’ to those in darkness, ‘Be shown!’ Along the roads they will graze— their pasture will be on all the barren heights. 
49:10 They will not hunger or thirst, nor scorching wind or sun strike them, for their compassionate One will lead them, and will guide them by springs of water. 
49:11 I will make all My mountains a road, and My highways will be raised up. 
49:12 “Behold, these shall come from afar. behold, these from the north and from the west, and from the land of Sinim. 
49:13 Shout for joy, heavens! Rejoice, earth! Break forth into ringing shouts, O mountains! For </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

49:17 Your children will come quickly. Your destroyers and devastators will go away from you. 
49:18 Lift up your eyes around and see: all of them will gather and come to you.” “As I live” —it is </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
49:19 For your waste and desolate places and your destroyed land will now be surely too small for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up will be far away. 
49:20 The children of your bereavement will yet say in your ears, “The place is too cramped for me! Make room for me to settle in.” 
49:21 Then you will say in your heart, “Who has borne these for me? Wasn’t I bereaved of my children— barren, an exile and wandering? So who has raised these? Behold, I was left alone— these, where were they?” 
49:22 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
49:23 Kings will be your guardians, their princesses your nurses. They will bow down to you with their face to the ground, and lick the dust of your feet. Then you will know that I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
49:24 Can plunder be taken from the mighty, or captives of the righteous freed?

50:3 I clothe the heavens with blackness and make sackcloth their covering.”
50:4  has given Me the tongue of the learned, that I may know how to sustain the weary with a word. He awakens Me morning by morning. He awakens My ear to give heed as a disciple. 
50:5  has opened My ear, and I was not rebellious, nor did I turn back. 
50:6 I gave My back to those who strike, and My cheeks to those pulling out My beard; I did not hide My face from humiliation and spitting.

52:14 Just as many were appalled at You— His appearance was disfigured more than any man, His form more than the sons of men.

53:3 He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief, One from whom people hide their faces. He was despised, and we did not esteem Him. 
53:4 Surely He has borne our griefs and carried our pains. Yet we esteemed Him stricken, struck by God, and afflicted. 
53:5 But He was pierced because of our transgressions, crushed because of our iniquities. The chastisement for our </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom

53:7 He was oppressed and He was afflicted yet He did not open His mouth. Like a lamb led to the slaughter, like a sheep before its shearers is silent, so He did not open His mouth. 
53:8 Because of oppression and judgment He was taken away. As for His generation, who considered? For He was cut off from the land of the living, for the transgression of my people— the stroke was theirs 
53:9 His grave was given with the wicked, and by a rich man in His death, though He had done no violence, nor was there any deceit in His mouth. 
53:10 Yet it pleased </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
53:11 As a result of the anguish of His soul He will see it and be satisfied by His knowledge. The Righteous One, My Servant will make many righteous and He will bear their iniquities. 
53:12 Therefore I will give Him a portion with the great, and He will divide the spoil with the mighty— because He poured out His soul to death, and was counted with transgressors. For He bore the sin of many, and interceded for the transgressors.

54:2 “Enlarge the place of your tent, stretch out your tabernacle curtains. Do not hold back— lengthen your cords, strengthen your stakes. 
54:3 For you will spread out to the right hand and to the left. Your offspring will possess the nations and will resettle the desolate cities. 
54:4 Fear not, for you will not be ashamed. Nor cringe, for you will not be disgraced. For you will forget the shame of your youth, and you will remember the reproach of your widowhood no more.

54:9 “For this is like the waters of Noah to Me: for as I swore that the waters of Noah should no more cover the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, nor will I rebuke you.

54:11 Afflicted one, storm-tossed, unconsoled, behold, I set your stones in antimony, lay your foundations with sapphires,

54:16 Behold, I created the smith who blows the fire of coals and produces a weapon for its work, and I created the destroyer to ruin. 
54:17 No weapon formed against you will prosper and you will condemn every tongue that rises against you in judgment. This is the heritage of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

55:3 Incline your ear and come to Me. Listen, so that your soul may live. I will make an everlasting covenant with you, the trustworthy loyalty to David.

56:6 Also the foreigners who join themselves to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
56:7 these I will bring to My holy mountain, and let them rejoice in My House of Prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be acceptable on My altar. For My House will be called a House of Prayer for all nations.” 
56:8 , who gathers the dispersed of Israel, declares, “I will gather still others to him, to those already gathered.” 
56:9 All you beasts of the field, come to eat, all you beasts in the forest. 
56:10 His watchmen are all blind. All of them know nothing. All of them are mute dogs unable to bark, dreamers lying down, lovers of slumber, 
56:11 and the dogs are greedy— they never have enough. They are shepherds with no discernment. They have all turned to their own way, each to his own gain, one and all. 
56:12 “Come, let’s get wine, let’s guzzle strong drink. Tomorrow will be like today, only even better!”
57:1 The righteous one perishes, but no one takes it to heart. Godly men are taken away, but no one discerns that the righteous man is taken from evil.

57:3 But as for you, come here, you children of a sorceress, offspring of an adulterer and prostitute. 
57:4 Whom are you mocking? At whom do you open your mouth wide and stick out your tongue? Are you not children of transgression, offspring of deceit? 
57:5 You who burn with lust among the oaks and under every green tree, who sacrifice your children in the wadis and under the clefts of the rocks? 
57:6 Among the smooth stones of the wadi is your portion—they are your lot. To them you have even poured out a drink offering, made a grain offering. Shall I relent concerning these things? 
57:7 Upon a high and lofty mountain you made your bed. You also went up there to offer sacrifice. 
57:8 Behind the door and the doorpost you have set up your memorial sign. For away from Me, you uncovered, went up and made your bed wide, and cut covenant with them. You loved their bed— you looked on their nakedness. 
57:9 You journeyed to the king with oil and multiplied your perfumes. You sent your ambassadors far away, and made them go down to </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Sheol
57:10 You wearied of the length of your way, yet you did not say, “It is hopeless!” You found renewed strength, so you did not weaken. 
57:11 “Whom was it you dreaded and feared, so that you lied. But you did not remember Me or take it to heart? Have I not kept silent a long time— yet you do not fear Me? 
57:12 I will expose your ‘righteousness’, and your deeds—they will not profit you. 
57:13 When you cry out, will your collection of idols save you? The wind will carry them off, a breath will take them away. But he who takes refuge in Me will possess the land, and will inherit My holy mountain.” 
57:14 Then it will be said: “Build up, build up, prepare the way, remove every stumbling block out of the way of My people.” 
57:15 For thus says the High and Exalted One who inhabits eternity, whose Name is Holy: “I dwell in a high and holy place, yet also with a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and revive the heart of the contrite. 
57:16 For I will not contend forever, nor will I always be angry, for the spirit would grow weak before Me, the breath of those whom I made. 
57:17 Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry; I struck him; I hid My face; I was angry—but he went on backsliding in the way of his heart. 
57:18 I have seen his ways, but I will heal him. I will lead him and restore comfort to him and his mourners.

58:3  “Why have we fasted. yet You do not see? Why have we afflicted our souls, yet You take no notice?” “Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure, and exploit all your laborers. 
58:4 Behold, you fast for strife and contention and to strike with a wicked fist. You should not fast as you do today to make your voice heard on high.

58:6 “Is not this the fast I choose: to release the bonds of wickedness, to untie the cords of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to tear off every yoke? 
58:7 Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, to bring the homeless poor into your house? When you see the naked, to cover him, and not hide yourself from your own flesh and blood? 
58:8 Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will spring up speedily. Your righteousness will go before you, the glory of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

59:2 Rather, your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God. Your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He does not hear. 
59:3 For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity. Your lips have spoken lies, your tongue mutters wickedness. 
59:4 No one sues justly, and none pleads a case honestly. They trust in confusion and speak lies. They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. 
59:5 They hatch adders’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web— whoever eats their eggs dies; crack one open, a viper breaks out. 
59:6 Their webs will not become clothing, nor will they cover themselves with what they make. Their deeds are works of iniquity, an act of violence is in their hands. 
59:7 Their feet run after evil. They rush to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity. Violence and ruin are on their highways. 
59:8 They do not know the path of peace, and there is no justice in their tracks. They have made their paths crooked. Whoever walks in them will not experience </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom
59:9 That is why justice is far from us and righteousness does not reach us. We hope for light, but behold darkness, for brightness, but walk in gloom. 
59:10 We grope along the wall like the blind. We grope like those with no eyes. We stumble at noon as at twilight. We are like the dead in desolation. 
59:11 All of us growl like bears or moan like doves. We hope for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us. 
59:12 For our transgressions are multiplied before You, and our sins testify against us, for our transgressions are with us, and we know our iniquities: 
59:13 transgressing and denying </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
59:14 Justice is turned back, and righteousness stands far off. For truth has stumbled in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.

59:16 He saw that there was no one— He was astonished that no one was interceding. Therefore His own arm brought salvation for Him, and His righteousness upheld Him. 
59:17 He put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation on His head. He clothed Himself in robes of vengeance and wrapped Himself in zeal as a cloak. 
59:18 According to their deeds, so He will repay: wrath to His adversaries, retribution to His enemies. To the islands He will repay as due. 
59:19 So from the west they will fear the Name of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

60:4 Lift up your eyes and look all around: they all gather—they come to you— your sons will come from far away, your daughters carried on the hip. 
60:5 Then you will see and be radiant, and your heart will throb and swell with joy. For the abundance of the sea will be turned over to you. The wealth of nations will come to you. 
60:6 A multitude of camels will cover you, young camels of Midian and Ephah, all those from Sheba will come. They will bring gold and frankincense, and proclaim the praises of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
60:7 All Kedar’s flocks will be gathered to you. Nebaioth’s rams will minister to you. They will go up with favor on My altar, and I will beautify My glorious House. 
60:8 Who are these who fly like a cloud, like doves to their windows? 
60:9 Surely the islands will hope in Me, with the ships of Tarshish in the lead, to bring your sons from afar, their silver and gold with them, for the Name of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
60:10 Foreigners will build up your walls, and their kings will minister to you. For in My fury I struck you, but in My favor I will show you mercy. 
60:11 Your gates will be open continually. They will not be shut day or night, so that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations, with their kings led in procession. 
60:12 For the nation and the kingdom which will not serve you will perish— those nations will be utterly ruined. 
60:13 The glory of Lebanon will come to you —cypress, elm and pine together— to beautify the place of My Sanctuary. I will give to the place of My feet glory. 
60:14 The sons of those who afflicted you will come bowing to you, and all those who despised you will fall at the soles of your feet. They will call you the city of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
60:15 Instead of deserted and hated, no one passing through, I will make you an eternal pride, joy from generation to generation.

61:4 They will rebuild the ancient ruins. They will restore former desolations. They will repair the ruined cities, the desolations of many generations.

63:2 “Why is Your apparel so red, and Your garments like one who treads in a wine press?” 
63:3 “I have trodden the winepress alone— from the peoples, no man was with Me. I trod them in My anger, and trampled them in My wrath. Their lifeblood spattered My garments, so I stained all My robes. 
63:4 For a day of vengeance was in My heart, and My year of redemption has come. 
63:5 I looked, but there was no one to help. I was amazed, but no one was assisting. So My own arm won victory for Me, and My wrath upheld Me. 
63:6 So I trod down the peoples in My anger, and made them drunk in My wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.” 
63:7 I will remember the lovingkindnesses of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
63:8 For He said, “Surely they are My people, children who will not deal falsely.” So He became their Savior. 
63:9 In all their affliction He was afflicted. So the angel of His presence saved them. In His love and in His mercy He redeemed them, then He lifted them and carried them all the days of old. 
63:10 But they rebelled, and grieved His </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach ha-Kodesh

63:15 Look down from heaven and see from Your holy, glorious, lofty abode. Where are Your zeal and mighty deeds? Are the yearnings of Your heart, Your compassions, withheld from me?

63:17 , why do You cause us to stray from Your ways, and harden our heart from fearing You? Return for Your servants’ sake, the tribes of Your heritage. 
63:18 Briefly Your holy people possessed it— our foes have trampled Your Sanctuary. 
63:19 We have become like those over whom You have never ruled, like those not called by Your Name. Oh, that You would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might quake at Your presence!
64:1 As fire kindles brushwood, as fire causes water to boil, make Your Name known to Your foes, so the nations may tremble before You! 
64:2 When You did awesome things that we were not expecting, You came down— the mountains shook at Your presence! 
64:3 For from days of old no one has heard, no ear perceived, no eye has seen God, except You, who acts on behalf of the one waiting for Him. 
64:4 You meet him who rejoices in doing righteousness, who remembers You in Your ways. Behold, You were angry. When we keep sinning all the time, would we be saved? 
64:5 For all of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteousness is like a filthy garment, and all of us wither like a leaf, and our iniquities carry us away, like the wind. 
64:6 No one calls on Your Name, or stirs himself up to take hold of You. For You have hidden Your face from us, and have consumed us, because of our iniquities.

64:8 Do not be angry much more, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
64:9 Your holy cities became a wilderness, Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.

65:5 who say, ‘Keep to yourself, don’t come to me, for I am holier than you!’ These are smoke in My nostrils, a fire that burns all day.

65:12 I will fate you to the sword, and all of you will kneel to slaughter. For I called, but you did not answer, I spoke, but you did not hear. So you did what was evil in My sight, and chose what I did not delight in.”

65:14 Behold, My servants will sing for joy with a happy heart, but you will cry from pain of heart, and wail out of a broken spirit.

65:20 No longer will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not fill out his days. For the youth will die at a hundred years, But one who misses the mark of a hundred must be accursed.

65:24 And it will come to pass that before they call, I will answer, and while they are still speaking, I will hear. 
65:25 The wolf and the lamb will feed together. The lion will eat straw like the ox, but dust will be the serpent’s food. They will not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
66:1 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
66:2 For My hand has made all these things, so all these things came to be,” declares </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
66:3 One who kills an ox is like one who kills a man; one who sacrifices a lamb is like one who breaks a dog’s neck; one who offers a grain offering is like one who offers swine’s blood; one who burns incense is like one who blesses an idol. They have chosen their own ways, so their soul delights in their abominations. 
66:4 So I will choose their punishments and bring on them what they dread. For when I called, no one answered; when I spoke, they did not listen. But they did what was evil in My eyes, and chose what I did not delight in. 
66:5 Hear the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
66:6 A sound of uproar from the city, a sound from the Temple— the sound of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
66:7 Before she was in labor, she gave birth. Before her pain came, she delivered a male child. 
66:8 Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Can a land be born in one day? Can a nation be brought forth at once? For as soon as Zion was in labor, she gave birth to her children. 
66:9 “Will I bring the moment of birth, and not give delivery?” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
66:10 Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you who love her. Rejoice for joy with her all you who mourned over her. 
66:11 For you will nurse and be satisfied from her comforting breast. You will drink deeply and delight from her glorious abundance. 
66:12 For thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
66:13 As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you, so you will be comforted in Jerusalem. 
66:14 You will see, your heart will rejoice, and your bones will flourish like grass. So the hand of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
66:15 For behold, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
66:16 For by fire and His sword </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
66:17 Those who consecrate and purify themselves to enter the groves, following after one in the midst, who eat swine’s flesh, vermin and mice, will come to an end altogether. It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
66:18 “For I know their works and their thoughts. It will come about that I will gather all nations and tongues, and they will come and see My glory. 
66:19 Then I will set up a sign among them, and I will send survivors from them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul and Lud (who pull the bow), to Tubal and Javan, to distant islands that have not heard My fame or seen My glory. Then they will declare My glory among the nations. 
66:20 “Then they will bring all your kinsmen from all the nations, as an offering to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
66:21 I will also take some of them as priests and for Levites,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
66:22 “For just as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, will endure before Me”—it is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
66:23 “And it will come to pass, that from one New Moon to another, and from one </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Shabbat
66:24 “As they leave, they will look on the corpses of the people who rebelled against Me. For their worm will not die, and their fire will not be quenched, and they will be a horror to all flesh.”
