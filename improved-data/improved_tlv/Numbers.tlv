1:2 “Do a head count of all the community of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
1:3 You and Aaron are to muster by their divisions every son from 20 years and upward available to serve in the army of Israel. 
1:4 One man from each tribe, each head of his father’s household, is to assist you. 
1:5 “These then are the names of the men who will assist you: from Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur. 
1:6 From Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai. 
1:7 From Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab. 
1:8 From Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar. 
1:9 From Zebulon, Eliab son of Helon. 
1:10 From the sons of Joseph—from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud, from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur. 
1:11 From Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni. 
1:12 From Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai. 
1:13 From Asher, Pagiel son of Ochran. 
1:14 From Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel. 
1:15 From Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan.” 
1:16 These were those selected from the community, princes of their ancestral tribes. They were heads of the thousands of Israel. 
1:17 So Moses and Aaron took these men designated by name. 
1:18 They assembled all the community on the first day of the second month. They declared their lineage according to their families, the households of their forefathers, with the number of the names of those 20 years old and upward being listed individually. 
1:19 Moses numbered Israel in the wilderness of Sinai just as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

1:42 From the sons of Naphtali (their generations by their families, their ancestral households, by number everyone 20 years old and upward who would go out with the army), 
1:43 those counted from the tribe of Naphtali were 53,400. 
1:44 These were the ones numbered—Moses, Aaron and the princes of Israel counted them. Each of the twelve men represented his ancestral house. 
1:45 So all those counted from </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
1:46 all those who were counted totaled 603,550.

3:16 So Moses numbered them in accordance with the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
3:17 These were the sons of Levi, by their names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
3:18 These then were the names of the sons of Gershon by their families—Libni and Shimei. 
3:19 The sons of Kohath by their families were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 
3:20 The sons of Merari, by their families, are Mahli and Mushi. These then were the families of the Levites by their ancestral households. 
3:21 To Gershon belonged the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimeites. These were the families of the Gershonites. 
3:22 The number of every male one month old and upward who were counted was 7,500. 
3:23 The Gershonites were to camp behind the Tabernacle on the west. 
3:24 The prince of the ancestral house of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael. 
3:25 The duties of the sons of Gershon in the Tent of Meeting were the Tabernacle, the tent, its coverings, the curtain of the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, 
3:26 the curtains of the courtyard, the screen of the entrance of the courtyard around the Tabernacle and altar, its ropes and all related to its use. 
3:27 To Kohath belonged the family of the Amramites, the family of the Izharites, the Hebronites and the Uzzielites. These were the Kohathite families. 
3:28 The number of every male one month old and upward was 8,600. Their duties were caring for the Sanctuary. 
3:29 The Kohathite families were to camp along the side of the Tabernacle on the south. 
3:30 The prince of the ancestral household of the Kohathites was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.

3:34 Their number by count of every male one month old and upward was 6,200. 
3:35 The prince of the household of the father of the Merarites was Zuriel son of Abihail. They were to camp on the north side of the Tabernacle. 
3:36 The sons of Merari were appointed over the care of the frames of the Tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, bases, and all equipment for its use, 
3:37 the posts of the surrounding courtyard, their bases, pegs and ropes. 
3:38 Those camping in front of the Tent of Meeting, on the east, toward the sunrise, were Moses, Aaron, and his sons. They were to care for the Sanctuary on behalf of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael

3:48 Give the money for the redemption of the extra ones of the firstborn of them to Aaron and his sons.” 
3:49 Hence Moses collected the redemption money for those exceeding the number redeemed by the Levites.

4:5 Whenever the camp is about to move out, Aaron and his sons are to take down the shielding curtain and cover the Ark of the Testimony with it.

4:7 “Then over the table of the Presence they are to spread a solid blue cloth, then lay on it the plates, ladles, bowls, and jars for the drink offering. The bread that is continually there is to remain there.

4:10 They then are to wrap it and all its accessories in a cover of porpoise hide and place it all on a carrying frame. 
4:11 “Over the golden altar they are to spread a blue cloth and cover that with a covering of porpoise hide, then put its poles in place. 
4:12 “They are to take all the utensils used for the service of the ministry of the Sanctuary, wrap them in a blue cloth, cover them with porpoise hide, and place them on a carrying frame. 
4:13 “They are to remove the ashes from the altar, then spread over it a purple cloth. 
4:14 They are to put onto it all the utensils with which they tend to the altar, among them the firepans, meat forks, shovels and sprinkling bowls. They are to spread over it a covering of porpoise hide and install its poles. 
4:15 “When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the Sanctuary and all its holy implements, and when the camp is ready to move out, after this the sons of Kohath may come to do the carrying. But they must not touch the holy items or they will die. These are the task of the sons of Kohath with regard to the Tent of Meeting. 
4:16 “Eleazar son of Aaron the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen

4:23 Count all the males from 30 to 50 years of age, everyone coming to work in the service of the Tent of Meeting. 
4:24 This is the task of the Gershonite families in working and carrying burdens. 
4:25 They are to carry the curtains of the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, its covering, the outer covering of porpoise hide, the curtains for the entrance for the Tent of Meeting, 
4:26 the curtains surrounding the courtyard and the altar, the curtain for the entrance, the ropes and all the equipment used in its operations. They are to do all that needs to be done with these things. 
4:27 The sons of the Gershonites are to do all their tasks, whether carrying or doing other work, according to the word of Aaron and his sons. You are to assign to them all that is their responsibility to carry. 
4:28 This is the duty of the families of the sons of the Gershonites regarding the Tent of Meeting. Their duty will be under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
4:29 Next, count the sons of Merari, according to their families and their ancestral houses,

4:33 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari as they work under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen

4:41 These were those counted from the families of the sons of Gershon, each serving in the Tent of Meeting—Moses and Aaron counted according to the mouth of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:42 Those were counted from the families and ancestral households of the sons of Merari,

4:45 These were those numbered from the families of the sons of Merari by Moses and Aaron in accordance with the mouth of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

7:1 When Moses finished setting up the Tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it and all its implements, the altar and all its utensils, and he anointed and consecrated them. 
7:2 Then the princes of Israel, heads of their ancestral houses—they were tribal princes in charge over those who were numbered—gave offerings. 
7:3 They brought as their gift before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
7:4  spoke to Moses saying, 
7:5 “Accept these from them to use in the service of the Tent of Meeting. Give them to the Levites to use as each man’s work requires.” 
7:6 So Moses took the carts and the oxen and he gave them to the Levites. 
7:7 He gave two carts and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, as their work required, 
7:8 and four carts and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, as their work required, under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen

7:89 When Moses entered the Tent of Meeting to speak with </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
8:2 “Speak to Aaron and say to him: When you erect the lamps, the seven lamps are to illuminate the area in front of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">menorah
8:3 Aaron did so. He erected the lamps facing forward so they illuminated the area in front of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">menorah
8:4 Now this is how the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">menorah

8:6 “Take the Levites from among </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
8:7 This is what you must do to them to make them clean: Sprinkle the purifying water on them, then have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes, thus purifying themselves. 
8:8 “Then they are to take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, plus a second young bull for a sin offering. 
8:9 Bring the Levites before the Tent of Meeting, and gather the whole community of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael

8:13 Have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons and present them as a wave offering to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:14 In this way you are to set apart the Levites from </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
8:15 After you have purified them and presented them as a wave offering, the Levites will come to do their work at the Tent of Meeting. 
8:16 For they are the ones from among </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
8:17 “For every firstborn among </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
8:18 So I am taking the Levites in place of the firstborn of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
8:19 and I am giving the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
8:20 So Moses, Aaron and the entire community of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
8:21 The Levites also purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes. Aaron presented them as a wave offering before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:22 After that, the Levites came to do their tasks before Aaron and his sons in the Tent of Meeting, just as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
8:23  again spoke to Moses saying, 
8:24 “This is for the Levites. Men 25 years old and upward are to present themselves for service to work in the Tent of Meeting. 
8:25 But at the age of 50 he is to retire from his service and work no longer. 
8:26 He may assist his brothers in the Tent of Meeting to do their duties, but he himself will no longer do the work. Thus, you are to assign to the Levites their responsibilities.”
9:1  spoke to Moses in the Sinai wilderness in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt saying, 
9:2 “</span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
9:3 You are to celebrate it at its appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month, with all its rules and regulations.” 
9:4 So Moses told </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
9:5 They celebrated Passover at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month in the Sinai wilderness. In accordance with all that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
9:6 However, there were some men who could not celebrate Passover because of being defiled by a dead body. So they came to Moses and Aaron on that same day, 
9:7 and these men said to him, “We have become unclean because of a dead man’s body. Why should we be kept from presenting the offering of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

9:11 They are to celebrate it at twilight on the fourteenth day of the second month. With </span><span class="it"><span class="content">matzot
9:12 They are not to leave any of it until morning, or break any bones. When they celebrate Passover they are to observe all its regulations.

9:15 On the day the Tabernacle was erected, the cloud covered the Tabernacle. By evening until morning, the cloud above the Tent of Testimony had an appearance like fire. 
9:16 It was that way continually. The cloud covered it, and by night it appeared like fire. 
9:17 Whenever the cloud lifted up from above the Tent, then </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael

9:21 At times the cloud remained only from evening until morning. When the cloud would lift, they would set out. Whether by day or by night, when the cloud lifted, they would set out. 
9:22 Whether for two days or a month or a year, while the cloud remained over the Tabernacle, </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
9:23 At </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
10:2 “Make two trumpets of hammered silver for yourself. They are for summoning the community and having the camps set out. 
10:3 Whenever both are sounded, the whole community is to gather toward you at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. 
10:4 But if only one is sounded, the princes—the heads of the tribes of Israel—are to gather toward you. 
10:5 When you sound the trumpet the first time, the camp of those camped on the east is to set out. 
10:6 When you sound the trumpet blast the second time, the camp of those camped on the south is to set out. Short blasts will be the signal for their moving out. 
10:7 To gather the whole national community, you are to sound the sustained blasts, but not the short blasts. 
10:8 The sons of Aaron, the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
10:9 Whenever you go to war in your own land against the enemy who is hostile to you, you are to sound short blasts of alarm. Then you will be remembered before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:10 Also at your days of rejoicing, feasts and new moons, you are to blow on the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. They will then be a reminder for you before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:11 On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud lifted up from above the Tabernacle of the Testimony. 
10:12 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
10:13 So they set out the first time by the mouth of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:14 The standard of the camp of the sons of Judah set out first by their divisions. Over them was Nahshon son of Amminadab. 
10:15 Over the division of the tribe of the sons of Issachar was Nethanel son of Zuar. 
10:16 Over the division of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun was Eliab son of Helon. 
10:17 Then the Tabernacle was disassembled, and the sons of Gershon and Merari, who were carrying it, set out. 
10:18 The standard of the camp of Reuben then set out, by their divisions. Over his division was Elizur son of Shedeur. 
10:19 Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai, was over the division of the tribe of the sons of Simeon. 
10:20 Over the division of the tribe of the sons of Gad was Eliasaph son of Deuel. 
10:21 Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy items. The Tabernacle was to be erected before their arrival. 
10:22 The standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim set out next, by their divisions. Over his division was Elishama son of Ammihud. 
10:23 Over the division of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh was Gamaliel son of Pedahzur. 
10:24 Over the division of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin was Abidan son of Gideoni. 
10:25 The standard of the camp of the tribe of the sons of Dan, being the rear guard of all the camps, set out by their divisions. Over his division was Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai. 
10:26 Pagiel son of Ochran, was over the division of the tribe of the sons of Asher. 
10:27 Ahira son of Enan, was over the division of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali. 
10:28 This is the order by which </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
10:29 Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out to the place about which </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:30 But he said to him, “I will not go, because I would rather go to my own country and to my own people.” 
10:31 But he said, “Do not leave us now, because you know where we should camp in the wilderness. You can be like eyes to us. 
10:32 If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:33 So they advanced from the mountain of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:34 The cloud of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:35 Whenever the Ark would set out, Moses would say: “Arise, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
10:36 Then whenever it came to rest, he would say: “Return, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:1 The people were murmuring in the ears of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:2 The people cried out to Moses, so Moses prayed to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:3 The name of that place was thus called Taberah because fire from </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:4 The grumblers among them began to have cravings, so </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
11:5 We remember the fish that we used to eat in Egypt, for free—the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic! 
11:6 But now we have no appetite. We never see anything but this </span><span class="it"><span class="content">manna
11:7 Now the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">manna
11:8 The people went about, gathered it up, and ground it in a hand mill or crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into cakes. It had a taste like something made with olive oil. 
11:9 When the dew descended on the camp at night, the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">manna
11:10 Moses heard the people wailing by their families, each man at the door to his tent. </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:11 So Moses asked </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:12 Did I conceive all these people, or did I give birth to them, that You should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom just as the nurse carries an infant’—to the land You promised to their fathers? 
11:13 Where can I get meat for all these people? For they wail to me saying, ‘Give us meat to eat!’ 
11:14 I am not able to carry all these people by myself! The load is too heavy for me! 
11:15 If this is how You are treating me, kill me now! If I have found favor in Your eyes, kill me please—don’t let me see my own misery!” 
11:16  said to Moses, “Bring me 70 of the elders of Israel whom you know to be elders of the people and their leaders. Take them to the Tent of Meeting, so they may stand with you there. 
11:17 Then I will come down and speak with you there, and, I will take some of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
11:18 “Now to the people say: Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, because you will eat meat, for you wailed in </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:19 You will eat—not for one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days, 
11:20 but for an entire month—until it is coming out of your nostrils and it becomes loathsome to you! For you rejected </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:21 Moses then said, “600,000 foot soldiers—the people I am in the middle of---yet You say, ‘I am going to give them meat to eat for an entire month?’ 
11:22 If flocks and herds were slaughtered, would they have enough? Or if all the fish in the sea were caught, would they have enough?” 
11:23 ’s arm too short? Now you will see whether My word will come true for you or not.”
11:24 So Moses went out and told the people </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:25  first rested on them, they prophesied—but never again. 
11:26 Two men, however, had remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad and the name of the other was Medad. The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
11:27 A young man ran and told Moses and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!” 
11:28 Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses since his youth, cried out and said, “Moses, my lord, stop them!” 
11:29 But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous on my behalf? If only </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:30 Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
11:31 Now a wind went out from </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:32 The people went out all that day and all that night and all the following day and collected quail. No one gathered less than ten omers. They spread them out all around the camp. 
11:33 Yet while the meat was between their teeth, before it was swallowed, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:34 For that reason the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah , because they buried the people who were craving. 
11:35 From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth and stayed in Hazeroth.
12:1 Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses on account of the Cushite woman he married, because he had married a Cushite woman. 
12:2 They asked, “Has </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:3 Now the man Moses was very humble, more so than anyone on the face of the earth. 
12:4 Immediately, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:5  descended in a column of cloud, stood at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and called to Aaron and Miriam. The two of them stepped forward. 
12:6 “Hear now My words!” He said. “When there is a prophet of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:7 Not so with My servant Moses. In all My house, he is faithful. 
12:8 I speak with him face to face, plainly and not in riddles. He even looks at the form of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:9 ’s anger burned against them, and He left them. 
12:10 When the cloud lifted up from above the Tent, behold, Miriam had </span><span class="it"><span class="content">tza'arat
12:11 He said to Moses, “Please, my lord, don’t hold against us the sin we have committed so foolishly! 
12:12 Don’t let her be like a stillborn baby, who comes from his mother’s womb with his flesh half-eaten away!” 
12:13 So Moses cried to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:14  said to Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not be in shame for seven days? Let her be confined outside the camp for seven days. After that she may be brought back.” 
12:15 So Miriam was restricted to outside the camp for seven days. The people did not move on until Miriam was brought back. 
12:16 Afterward, the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the Wilderness of Paran.
13:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
13:2 “Send some men on your behalf to investigate the land of Canaan, which I am giving to </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
13:3 So according to the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:4 These are their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur. 
13:5 From the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori. 
13:6 From the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh. 
13:7 From the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph. 
13:8 From the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun. 
13:9 From the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu. 
13:10 From the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi. 
13:11 From the tribe of Manasseh, part of the tribe of Joseph, Gaddi son of Susi. 
13:12 From the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli. 
13:13 From the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael. 
13:14 From the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi. 
13:15 From the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Machi. 
13:16 These are the names of the men Moses sent to investigate the land. (Now he gave Hoshea son of Nun, the name Joshua.) 
13:17 As he sent them to explore the land of Canaan, he said to them, “Go up there through the Negev, then go up into the hill country. 
13:18 See what the land is like and the people living there, whether they might be strong or weak, few or many. 
13:19 In what kind of land are they living? Is it good or bad? Also, what about the cities in which they are living? Are they unwalled or do they have fortifications? 
13:20 How is the soil—fertile or poor? Are there trees on it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land.” (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.) 
13:21 So they went up and explored the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob the entrance of Hamath. 
13:22 They continued on up through the Negev and came to Hebron. There lived Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, descendants of Anak. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
13:23 When they reached as far as the Valley of Eshcol, they cut a single branch with a cluster of grapes. It was carried on a pole between two of them. They also cut some pomegranates and some figs. 
13:24 That place was called the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster cut by </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
13:25 They returned from investigating the land after 40 days. 
13:26 They traveled and returned to Moses, Aaron and the entire community of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
13:27 They gave their account to him and said, “We went into the land where you sent us. Indeed it is flowing with milk and honey—this is some of its fruit. 
13:28 Except, the people living in the land are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw the sons of Anak there! 
13:29 Amalek is living in the land of the Negev, the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites are living in the mountains, and the Canaanites are living near the sea and along the bank of the Jordan.” 
13:30 Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, “We should definitely go up and capture the land, for we can certainly do it!” 
13:31 But the men who had gone up with him said, “We cannot attack these people, because they are stronger than we.” 
13:32 They spread among </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
13:33 We also saw there the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Nephilim
14:1 All through that night, the entire community raised up their voices. The people wept. 
14:2 All </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
14:3 Why is </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:4 They said to each other, “Let’s choose a leader and let’s go back to Egypt!” 
14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before the entire assembly of the community of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
14:6 Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes. 
14:7 They said to the whole assembly of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
14:8 If </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:9 Only don’t rebel against </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:10 But the whole assembly talked about violently stoning them. Then the glory of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:11  said to Moses, “How long will these people treat Me contemptibly? How long will they neglect to trust in Me—in spite of all the miraculous signs I have performed among them? 
14:12 I will strike them with the plague. I will destroy them. But you I will make into a nation greater and stronger than they!” 
14:13 Moses said to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:14 They will tell the residents of this land about it. Already they have heard that You, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:15 If you kill these people all at once, the nations who have heard this report about You will say, 
14:16 ‘Because </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:17 “So please, let </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:18 ‘</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:19 Forgive now the guiltiness of this people in accordance with the greatness of Your lovingkindness, just as You have pardoned this people from Egypt until now!” 
14:20  answered, “I have forgiven them just as you have spoken. 
14:21 But as certainly as I live and as certainly as the glory of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:22 none of the people who saw My glory and My miraculous signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness—yet tested Me these ten times and did not obey My Voice—
14:23 not one of them will see the land I promised to their forefathers. None of those who treated Me with contempt will see it! 
14:24 However, My servant Caleb, because a different spirit is with him and he is wholeheartedly behind Me, I will bring him into the land where he went—his offspring will inherit it. 
14:25 Now since the Amalekites and Canaanites are inhabiting the valley, turn back tomorrow and set out by the wilderness route toward the Sea of Reeds.” 
14:26  then said to Moses and Aaron saying, 
14:27 “How long will this wicked community be grumbling against Me? I have heard the complaints of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
14:28 So tell them, ‘As surely as I live,’ says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:29 In this very wilderness your bodies will drop—every one of you 20 years of age and older who was numbered in the census and grumbled against Me. 
14:30 Not one of you will enter the land about which I lifted My hand to make home for you—except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. 
14:31 “As for your children—whom you said would be like plunder—I will bring them in and they will experience the land that you spurned. 
14:32 But your bodies will drop in this wilderness. 
14:33 Your children will be herdsmen in the wilderness for 40 years. They will suffer because of your unfaithfulness until your corpses are consumed in the wilderness. 
14:34 For 40 years, corresponding to the number of the 40 days you explored the land—one year for each day—you will suffer for your iniquities and know My hostility. 
14:35 I, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:36 Then the men whom Moses had sent to explore the land, who had returned and caused the whole community to grumble against him by spreading a bad report about the land, 
14:37 these men, spreading the bad report about the land, died of the plague in </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:38 Of those men who had gone to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived. 
14:39 When Moses related these things to all of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
14:40 They rose the next morning and went up to the high mountains, saying, “Look! Let’s go up to the place which </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:41 But Moses said, “Why are you disobeying the mouth of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:42 You should not go up, because </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:43 For the Amalekites and Canaanites are there in front of you, and you will fall by the sword. </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:44 But presumptuously they went up to the high mountain country, though neither the Ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:45 The Amalekites and Canaanites living in the mountain country came down, attacked them, and beat them down all the way to Hormah.
15:1 Again </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:2 “Speak to </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
15:3 and you are presenting a fire offering to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:4 the one bringing the offering is to present a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil. 
15:5 “Now with each lamb for the burnt offering or sacrifice, you are to prepare a fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering. 
15:6 With a ram, you are to prepare two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil, 
15:7 and a third of a hin of wine as a drink offering. You are to offer it as a pleasing aroma to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:8 “Whenever you are to prepare a young bull for a burnt offering, a special vow offering, or a fellowship offering to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:9 bring with the young bull a grain offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil. 
15:10 You are to also offer as the drink offering half a hin of wine as a fire offering, a pleasing aroma to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:11 This is to be done for each bull or ram, for each young goat or lamb. 
15:12 Do this for each one, for as many as you prepare. 
15:13 “Everyone native-born is to do these things like so when bringing a fire offering as a pleasant aroma to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:14 Whenever an outsider resides with you, or whoever is among you for your generations to come, and he is to present a fire offering as a fragrant aroma to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:15 “The community will have the same rule for you as well as for the resident outsider. It will be a lasting statute throughout your generations. As for you, so for the outsider will it be before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:16 The same </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
15:17  spoke to Moses saying, 
15:18 “Speak to </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
15:19 and you eat some of the food of the land, you are to offer a portion to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:20 You are to offer a cake from the first of your ground-up meal as an offering from your threshing floor—so you are to lift it up. 
15:21 Throughout your generations to come, you are to give this offering from the first of your ground-up meal.
15:22 “If you unintentionally fail, not keeping any of these </span><span class="it"><span class="content">mitzvot
15:23  —that is, anything that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

15:33 Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses, Aaron and the entire assembly. 
15:34 They kept him under arrest, not being clear what was to be done to him. 
15:35  said to Moses, “The man has to die. The whole assembly is to stone him with stones outside the camp.” 
15:36 So the whole assembly took him outside the camp. They stoned him with stones. He died just as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:37  spoke to Moses saying, 
15:38 “Speak to </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael

16:1 Now Korah, son of Izhar son of Kohath son of Levi, and sons of Reuben—Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth—
16:2 rose up against Moses and took 250 men from </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
16:3 They assembled against Moses and Aaron. They said to them, “You’ve gone too far! All the community is holy—all of them—and </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:4 When Moses heard this, he fell on his face. 
16:5 Then he said to Korah and all his following saying, “In the morning </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:6 Do this, Korah and your whole following! Take for yourselves censers. 
16:7 Put fire and incense into them in the presence of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:8 Moses also said to Korah, “Listen now, sons of Levi! 
16:9 Isn’t it enough that the God of Israel has set you apart from the community of Israel to bring you near to Him to do the work of the Tabernacle of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:10 So He brought you close, along with all your fellow sons of Levi. But you are seeking the priesthood, too! 
16:11 Therefore you and all your following are banding together against </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:12 Then Moses sent word to call Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab. But they said, “We will not come! 
16:13 Isn’t it enough that you brought us from a land flowing with milk and honey, only to kill us in the wilderness? And now you would lord it over us? 
16:14 What’s more, you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Would you now gouge out the eyes of those men? We won’t come!” 
16:15 Then Moses became very angry and said to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:16 So Moses said to Korah, “You and your whole following are to appear before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:17 Each man will take his censer and you are to put incense into them—250 censers total. You are to present it before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:18 So each man took his censer, put fire and incense into it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. 
16:19 When Korah and all his following had assembled in opposition to them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, then the glory of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:20 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:21 “Separate yourselves from among this assembly, so that I may consume them at once!” 
16:22 But they fell on their faces and cried out, “O God, God of the spirits of all flesh, if one man sins, will you be angry with the entire community?” 
16:23 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:24 “Speak to the assembly saying, ‘Move away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan and Abiram!’” 
16:25 Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram. The elders of Israel followed after him. 
16:26 He warned the assembly saying, “Move away from the tents of these wicked men! Don’t touch anything that is theirs, or you will be swept away because of all their sins!” 
16:27 So they moved away from near the dwelling of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram came outside and were standing at the entrance of their tents with their wives, their children, and their little ones. 
16:28 Moses said, “By this you will know that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:29 If every one of these men die a common death and experience what happens to all people, then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:30 But if </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:31 As soon as he finished saying all these things, the ground split under them. 
16:32 The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, along with all their households, all of Korah’s people and all their possessions. 
16:33 They went down alive into </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Sheol
16:34 All Israel around them fled at their outcry, for they shouted, “Perhaps the earth will swallow us!” 
16:35 Fire also came out from </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:36  spoke to Moses saying, 
16:37 “Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
16:38 As for the censers of these men who sinned at the cost of their lives, let them be taken and hammered into sheets as a covering for the altar. For they were presented before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:39 So Eleazar the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
16:40 just as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:41 The next day, the entire community of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
16:42 But when they gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the Tent of Meeting, behold, the cloud covered it and the glory appeared! 
16:43 Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting. 
16:44  spoke to Moses saying, 
16:45 “Get away from among this assembly so that I may immediately consume them!” So they fell on their faces. 
16:46 Then Moses said to Aaron, “Take the censer, put into it fire from the altar and put in incense. Get going and hurry to the assembly and make atonement for them, because wrath has come out from </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:47 Aaron did just as Moses had said, and ran into the middle of the assembly. Behold, the plague had already started among the people. But he offered the incense and made atonement for the people. 
16:48 He stood between the dead and the living and the plague stopped. 
16:49 However, there were 14,700 dead from the plague, besides those who died because of Korah. 
16:50 Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, when the plague had been halted.
17:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
17:2 “Speak to </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
17:3 Write Aaron’s name on Levi’s staff, for there is to be one staff for the prince of each tribe. 
17:4 Then you are to place them in the Tent of Meeting, before the Testimony, where I meet with you. 
17:5 It will come about that the staff of the man I choose will sprout. I will then rid Myself of the grumblings of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
17:6 So Moses spoke to </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
17:7 Moses placed the staffs before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:8 The next day, Moses entered the Tent of Testimony and behold, Aaron’s staff, from the house of Levi, had sprouted, blossomed, and produced almonds! 
17:9 Moses then brought all the staffs from </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:10  said to Moses, “Put Aaron’s staff back in front of the Testimony to keep as a sign to the sons of rebellion, so that it may put an end to their grumblings against Me, and so they will not die.” 
17:11 Moses did just as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:12 But </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
17:13 Anyone approaching the Tabernacle of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:1  said to Aaron, “You, your sons, and the house of your father with you will bear the guilt for the Sanctuary, and you and your sons will bear the guilt for your priesthood. 
18:2 Bring with you your brothers, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, so that they may join you and assist you, both you and your sons with you, before the Tent of the Testimony. 
18:3 They are to perform their duties for you and for all matters related to the Tent. They must not approach the implements of the Sanctuary or the altar—otherwise, both you and they will die. 
18:4 They are to team with you and attend to the Tent of Meeting, for all the service of the Tent. But no unauthorized person may intrude upon you. 
18:5 So you are to attend to the Sanctuary and the care of the altar, so no further wrath will fall on </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
18:6 “See, I have personally taken your kinsmen, the Levites, from among </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
18:7 But you and your sons with you are to maintain your priesthood for everything pertaining to the altar and inside the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">parokhet
18:8  I have given to you as set aside for you and your sons as a permanent share. 
18:9 You are to have the part of the most holy things that is kept from the fire. Whether grain, sin or guilt offerings that they bring to Me as most holy—they are for you and your sons. 
18:10 You are to eat it as most holy. Every male may eat it— it is set apart for you. 
18:11 This also is yours: the gift of the wave offerings of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
18:12 All the finest olive oil, the finest new wine and grain they give to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:13 All the firstfruits of the land that they bring to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:14 Every devoted thing in Israel is yours. 
18:15 The first offspring of the womb from all flesh, whether human or animal, offered to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:16 When they are a month old, you are to redeem them at the redemption price of five shekels of silver by the Sanctuary shekel, or 20 gerahs. 
18:17 But the firstborn of the ox, sheep or goat you are not to redeem. They are holy. You are to sprinkle their blood on the altar, and their fat you are to burn as a fire offering, a pleasing aroma to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:18 Their meat—the breast of the wave offering and the right thigh—is yours. 
18:19 Whatever is set aside from the holy offerings which </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
18:20 . 
18:21 See, I have given all the tithes in Israel to the sons of Levi as an inheritance in return for all the work of the service they are doing in the Tent of Meeting. 
18:22 From now on, </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
18:23 The Levites will perform the service of the Tent of Meeting. They will bear the responsibility for their iniquity. It is a permanent ordinance throughout your generations. So among </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
18:24 For I have given the tithes that </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
18:25  spoke to Moses saying,

18:27 Your offering will be reckoned as grain from the threshing floor or the fullness of the winepress.

18:31 You and your household may eat it in any place. It is your wage for your service in the Tent of Meeting.

19:13 Anyone touching the dead body of any man, who does not purify himself, defiles </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:14 “This is the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
19:15 Any open container not having a lid fastened on it will also be unclean. 
19:16 Anyone out in the open field who touches a dead body, whether killed by a sword or was killed by a natural cause, or touches a human bone or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. 
19:17 “For the unclean one, they are to take some of the ash of the burnt purification offering, and pour some fresh water into a jar. 
19:18 Then a clean person will take some hyssop, dip it into the water, and, sprinkle it on the tent, all of the furnishings, and the people who were there, as well as the one touching the bone, the one killed, the corpse or the grave. 
19:19 The clean person will sprinkle the unclean one on the third and seventh days. He is to purify himself on the seventh day, and on the seventh day he is to wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and at evening he will be clean.
19:20 However, that man who is unclean but does not purify himself will be cut off from the community. He has defiled the Sanctuary of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
19:21 This will be a permanent ordinance for them. The one sprinkling the cleansing water is also to wash his clothes, and anyone touching the cleansing water will be unclean until evening. 
19:22 Anything touched by an unclean person becomes unclean, and anyone touching it will be unclean until evening.”
20:1 In the first month, the entire community of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:2 Now there was no water for the community, so they assembled against Moses and Aaron. 
20:3 The people quarreled with Moses saying, “If only we had died when our brothers died before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:4 Now why have you brought the community of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:5 Why have you brought us from Egypt to bring us to this evil place—a place without grain, fig, grapevine or pomegranate—and there’s no water to drink!” 
20:6 So Moses and Aaron went from before the assembly to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and fell on their faces. Then the glory of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:7  spoke to Moses saying, 
20:8 “Take the staff and gather the assembly, you and your brother Aaron. Speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will give out its water. You will bring out water from the rock, and you will give the community something to drink, along with their livestock.” 
20:9 So Moses took the staff from before the presence of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:10 Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock. He said, “Listen now, you rebels! Must we bring you water from this rock?” 
20:11 Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with the staff. Water gushed out and the community and its livestock drank. 
20:12 But </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:13 These are the waters of Meribah where </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:14 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom. “Thus says your brother, Israel: ‘You know all the hardship that came on us. 
20:15 Our forefathers went down to Egypt, so we lived there for a very long time. The Egyptians mistreated us, and our fathers. 
20:16 But we cried out to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:17 Permit us to pass through your territory. We will not cross through any field or vineyard or drink water of any well. But we will travel on the king’s highway. We will not deviate to the right or left until we will have passed through your territory.’” 
20:18 But Edom said to him, “You may not pass through me—or I will march out against you with the sword.” 
20:19  then said to him, “We will travel on the main road, and if we or our livestock even drink any of your water, we will pay its price. It’s nothing, just to pass through on foot!” 
20:20 He answered, “You may not pass through!” Yet Edom came out to oppose them with a large and well-armed people. 
20:21 Since Edom refused to permit Israel to cross through her territory, Israel turned away from them.
20:22 The entirety of the community of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:23 Now at Mount Hor, near the Edomite border, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:24 “Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land, which I have given to </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
20:25 Take Aaron and his son Eleazar, and take them up Mount Hor. 
20:26 Remove Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, and Aaron will be gathered up and will die there.” 
20:27 Moses did as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:28 Moses removed Aaron’s garments and placed them on Eleazar his son. Aaron died there at the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar descended the mountain. 
20:29 When they saw that Aaron had died, the entire community mourned Aaron 30 days.
21:1 When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked Israel and captured some of them. 
21:2 Then Israel vowed to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:3  listened to Israel’s plea and delivered up the Canaanites. They put them and their cities under the ban of destruction. So the name of the place was called Hormah. 
21:4 They travelled from Mount Hor along the route to the Sea of Reeds in order to go around the land of Edom. The spirit of the people became impatient along the way. 
21:5 The people spoke against God and Moses: “Why have you brought us from Egypt to die in the wilderness, because there is no bread, no water, and our very spirits detest the despicable food? 
21:6 So </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:7 The people came to Moses and said, “We sinned when we spoke against </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:8  said to Moses, “Make yourself a fiery snake and put it on a pole. Whenever anyone who has been bitten will look at it, he will live.” 
21:9 So Moses made a bronze snake and put it on a pole, and it happened that whenever a snake bit anyone and he looked at the bronze snake, he lived. 
21:10  moved on and encamped at Oboth. 
21:11 Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Ije-abarim, in the wilderness facing Moab toward the sunrise. 
21:12 From there they set out and camped in the Wadi Zered. 
21:13 They set out from there and camped along the Arnon, which is in the wilderness extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is also the border between Moab and the Amorites. 
21:14 Therefore, it is said in the Book of the Wars of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:15 and the slope of the wadis that leads to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab—” 
21:16 And from there—on to Beer. This is the well where </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:17 Then Israel sang this song, “Spring up, O well! Sing about it!” 
21:18 The well the princes dug, that the nobles of the people sank with their scepter and their staffs.” From the wilderness they went on to Mattanah. 
21:19 From Mattanah they went on to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 
21:20 and from Bamoth to the valley in the field of Moab where the peak of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland.
21:21 Israel sent messengers to King Sihon of the Amorites saying, 
21:22 “Permit us to pass through your land. We will not turn aside into field or vineyard nor drink water from the wells. We will travel on the king’s highway until we will have passed through your territory.” 
21:23 But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. Instead, Sihon called out his entire army and marched out into the desert to oppose Israel. When he came to Jahaz, he fought against Israel. 
21:24 But Israel struck him by the sword’s edge and conquered his land from Arnon to Jabbok as far as the Ammonites, because the border of the sons of Ammon was fortified. 
21:25 Israel conquered all these cities and occupied all the Amorite cities, Heshbon and all its towns. 
21:26 Heshbon was the city of King Sihon of the Amorites, who had fought with the former king of Moab and had taken from his control all the land as far as the Arnon. 
21:27 Therefore the poets say, “Come to Heshbon! Let her be rebuilt! Let the city of Sihon be restored! 
21:28 For fire went out from Heshbon, a blaze from the city of Sihon! It consumed Ar of Moab, the masters of Arnon’s heights! 
21:29 Woe to you, O Moab! You have been destroyed, people of Chemosh! He has given up his sons as refugees and his daughters as captives to Sihon, king of the Amorites. 
21:30 But we overthrew them! Heshbon as far as Dibon is destroyed! We have demolished them as far as Nophah up to Medeba.” 
21:31 So Israel was living in the land of the Amorites. 
21:32 After Moses sent spies to Jazer, they captured her towns and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
21:33 Then they turned and went up the road to the Bashan. Og, king of the Bashan, went out to confront them, he and all his people, in battle at Edrei. 
21:34  said to Moses, “Do not fear him. I have given him with all his people and his land into your hand. You are to do to him just as you did to Sihon, the Amorite king who was living in Heshbon.” 
21:35 So they struck him and his sons and his entire army until no survivor was left to him, and they possessed his land.
22:1 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
22:2 When Balak son of Zippor, realized all that </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
22:3 Moab became terrified because there were so many people. Moab was filled with dread because of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
22:4 Moab said to the elders of Midian, “The multitude will lick up everything around us like the ox licks up the grass of the field.” Now Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. 
22:5 He sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, at Pethor near the River in his native land, saying to him, “Look now, a people has come out of Egypt. See now, they cover the surface of the earth and are settling beside me. 
22:6 Come now, curse this people for me, because they are too strong for me! Perhaps I may be able to defeat them and drive them away from the country. I know that whoever you bless will be blessed and whoever you curse will be accursed!” 
22:7 The elders of Moab and Midian left with divination fees in their hand. When they came to Balaam, they told him Balak’s words. 
22:8 He said to them, “Spend the night here. I will give you an answer just as </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:9 God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?” 
22:10 Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent word to me: 
22:11 See, the people coming out of Egypt cover the surface of the land. Come now, curse them for me. Perhaps I will be able to fight against them and drive them away!” 
22:12 God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them! Do not curse them, for they are blessed!” 
22:13 So Balaam got up in the morning and said to the officials of Balak, “Go back to your country, for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:14 So the Moabite officials got up, went back to Balak, and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.” 
22:15 Balak again sent other dignitaries, more numerous and honored than these previous ones. 
22:16 They also came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak son of Zippor: Please let nothing keep you from coming to me! 
22:17 I will richly reward you, and everything you tell me I will do! Just come now and curse this people for me!” 
22:18 But Balaam answered Balak’s servants, “Even if Balak gave me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot cross beyond the mouth of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:19 But now, you may spend the night here, too. Then I may find out anything else </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:20 God came to Balaam by night and said to him, “Since the men came to you to summon you, arise and go with them. However, only the word I tell you are you to do!” 
22:21 So Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the Moabite princes. 
22:22 But the anger of God burned because he was going. The angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:23 when the donkey saw the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:24 Then the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:25 When the donkey saw the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:26 The angel again moved. He stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, right or left. 
22:27 When the donkey saw the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:28 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:29 Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you’ve made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you now!” 
22:30 The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey which you have ridden as always to this day? Have I ever been in the habit of doing this to you?” “No,” he said. 
22:31 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:32 The angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:33 The donkey saw Me and turned away from Me these three times. If she had not turned away from Me, by now I would have killed you indeed, but let her live!” 
22:34 Balaam said to the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:35 The angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:36 When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to greet him at the Moabite city on the border of the Arnon, the frontier of the territory. 
22:37 Balak said to Balaam, “Didn’t I send you an urgent summons? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I really unable to reward you?” 
22:38 “Look, I have come to you now!” Balaam said to Balak. “Can I just say anything? I must speak only the message which God puts into my mouth.” 
22:39 Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath-huzoth. 
22:40 Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep and sent some to Balaam and the princes who were with him. 
22:41 In the morning, Balak took Balaam with him to Bamoth-baal, and from there he saw part of the people.
23:1 Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.” 
23:2 So Balak did just as Balaam had said. Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
23:3 Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering. I will go and perhaps </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:4 God met with Balaam and he said to Him, “I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I offered a bull and a ram.” 
23:5  put a message into Balaam’s mouth and said, “Return to Balak and speak this.” 
23:6 Balaam went back to him. Behold, he was standing beside his offering with all the princes of Moab. 
23:7 Then he uttered his oracle and said, “From Aram, Balak brought me, Moab’s king from the mountains of the east: ‘Come! Curse Jacob for me! ‘Come! Denounce Israel!’ 
23:8 How can I curse one whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce one whom </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:9 From the rocky peaks I see him. From the heights I behold him. Look, he lives as a nation apart, and does not consider himself as being like the other nations. 
23:10 Who can count Jacob’s dust? Who can number a fourth of Israel? Let my soul die the death of the upright, and let my end be like his!” 
23:11 Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but look, you’ve actually blessed them!” 
23:12 But in response he said, “Mustn’t I speak whatever </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:13 Then Balak said to him, “Come now with me to another place where you can see a part of them only, not all of them. Curse them for me from there.” 
23:14 He took him to Lookout Field on top of Pisgah. He built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
23:15 “Stay here beside your offering,” he said to Balak, “while I am meeting over there.” 
23:16  met Balaam there and put a message into his mouth, and said, “Return to Balak and speak thus.” 
23:17 So he went to him, and behold, he and the princes of Moab were standing beside his offering. Balak asked him, “What did </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:18 So he uttered his oracle and said: “Rise, Balak! Hear me, son of Zippor! 
23:19 God is not a man who lies, or a son of man who changes his mind! Does He speak and then not do it, or promise and not fulfill it? 
23:20 Look, I received a command to bless. He has blessed—I cannot change it! 
23:21 No misfortune is to be seen in Jacob, and no misery in Israel! </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:22 God is bringing them from Egypt with the strong horns of the wild ox! 
23:23 There is no sorcery effective against Jacob, nor any divination against Israel! Now it will be said of Jacob and Israel, ‘See what God has done!’ 
23:24 The people rise like a lioness, like a lion who does not rest until he eats his prey and drinks his victim’s blood!” 
23:25 Then Balak said to Balaam, “Do not curse them or bless them at all!” 
23:26 Balaam answered and said to Balak, “Haven’t I told you, ‘All that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:27 Balak said to Balaam, “Come with me to another place. Perhaps it will be pleasing to God and you may curse them for me from there.” 
23:28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland. 
23:29 Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.” 
23:30 Balak did just as Balaam said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
24:1 When Balaam realized that it was pleasing in the eyes of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:2 Lifting up his eyes, Balaam saw Israel dwelling by tribes. The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach Elohim
24:3 He uttered his oracle and said: “This is the oracle of Balaam son of Beor, and the oracle of a strong man whose eye has been opened, 
24:4 the oracle of one hearing God’s speech, one seeing Shaddai’s vision, one fallen down, yet with open eyes: 
24:5 How lovely are your tents, O Jacob, and your dwellings, O Israel! 
24:6 Like valleys they are spread out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:7 Water will flow from his buckets, his seed by abundant water. His king will be greater than Agag , his kingdom will be exalted. 
24:8 God is bringing him out of Egypt. like the strong horns of a wild ox. He devours nations hostile to him. He will crush their bones. His arrows will pierce them. 
24:9 He crouches like a lion or a lioness— who would rouse him? He who blesses you will be blessed, and he who curses you will be cursed.” 
24:10 Then Balak became furious at Balaam, and struck his hands together. Balak said to Balaam, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but look, you have blessed them these three times! 
24:11 Now, go home! I said I would reward you, but see, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:12 Balaam answered Balak, “Didn’t I indeed tell your messengers whom you sent to me saying: 
24:13 ‘If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the mouth of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:14 Now, behold, I am going back to my people. Come, let me counsel you what these people will do to your people in the latter days. 
24:15 Then he uttered his oracle: The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the strong man whose eye is opened, 
24:16 the oracle of one hearing God’s speech, one experiencing Elyon’s knowledge, one seeing Shaddai’s vision, one fallen down, yet with open eyes: 
24:17 ‘I see him, yet not at this moment. I behold him, yet not in this location. For a star will come from Jacob, a scepter will arise from Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab and the skulls of all the sons of Seth. 
24:18 Edom will be conquered— his enemies will conquer Seir, but Israel will triumph. 
24:19 One from Jacob will rule and destroy the city’s survivors.” 
24:20 Then he saw Amalek, so he uttered his oracle and said: “Amalek was the first of nations, but will come to ruin at last.” 
24:21 Then he saw the Kenite, so he uttered his oracle and said, “Your dwelling is secure. Your nest is set in the rock. 
24:22 Yet Kain will be destroyed, when Asshur captures you.” 
24:23 Again he uttered his oracle and said, “O, who can live when God does this? 
24:24 Ships will come from Kittim’s shore. They will afflict Asshur and Eber, but they too will come to destruction.” 
24:25 Then Balaam got up and went and returned to his own place, and Balak went on his way.
25:1 While Israel was staying in Shittim, the people began to have immoral sexual relations with women from Moab. 
25:2 Then they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, so the people were eating, and bowing down before their gods. 
25:3 When Israel became bound to Baal of Peor, the anger of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:4 ’s fierce anger may be turned away from Israel.” 
25:5 So Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Each of you, kill your men who have been joining themselves to Baal of Peor.” 
25:6 Then behold, a man from </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael

25:9 However, 24,000 were dead because of the plague!
25:10 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:11 “Phinehas son of Eleazar son of Aaron the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
25:12 So now say: See, I am making with him a covenant of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">shalom
25:13 It will be for him and his descendants after him a covenant of an everlasting priesthood—because he was zealous for his God and atoned for </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
25:14 The name of the Israelite man killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, a prince of a Simeonite ancestral household. 
25:15 The name of the executed Midianite woman was Cozbi, daughter of Zur—he was a tribal head of an ancestral house in Midian. 
25:16  spoke to Moses saying, 
25:17 “Deal with the Midianites as enemies and strike them. 
25:18 For they have been enemies to you in their deceptions of you in the matter of Peor and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite prince, their sister who was slain on the day of the plague on account of the Peor incident.”
26:1 After the plague, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:2 “Take a headcount of the entire community of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael

26:6 by Hezron the Hezronite family, and by Carmi the Carmite family, 
26:7 these Reubenite families numbered 43,730. 
26:8 The son of Pallu was Eliab. 
26:9 The sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These were the Dathan and Abiram who were community leaders who rebelled against Moses and Aaron and were among the following of Korah in their rebellion against </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:10 Then the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them with Korah, whose followers died when the fire consumed the 250 men, these men serving as a warning. 
26:11 Korah’s sons, however, did not die. 
26:12 The sons of Simeon by their families were: by Nemuel the family of the Nemuelites, by Jamin the family of the Jaminites, by Jachin the family of the Jachinites, 
26:13 by Zerach the family of the Zerachites, and by Shaul the family of the Shaulites. 
26:14 These families of the Simeonites numbered 22,200. 
26:15 The sons of Gad by their families were: by Zephon the family of the Zephonites, by Haggi the family of the Haggites, by Shuni the family of the Shunites,

26:18 The sons of Gad numbered 40,500. 
26:19 Er and Onan were sons of Judah but had died in the land of Canaan. 
26:20 The sons of Judah by their families were: by Shelah the Shelanite family, by Perez the Perezite family, by Zerach the Zerachite family. 
26:21 The sons of Perez: by Hezron the Hezronite family, by Hamul the Hamulite family. 
26:22 These were the sons of Judah. They numbered 76,500. 
26:23 The sons of Issachar by their families were: Tola and the family of the Tolaites, by Puvah the Punite family,

26:53 “The land is to be divided to these as an inheritance according to the number of names. 
26:54 For the larger, you are to make his inheritance larger, and to the smaller you are to make his inheritance smaller. Each is to receive his inheritance in proportion to his population. 
26:55 Certainly the land is to be divided by lot. They will inherit it according to the names of their ancestral tribes. 
26:56 The division of the inheritance of larger and smaller tribes is to be decided by the lot.”

30:3 “Suppose a woman in her youth vows to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:4 If her father should hear her vow or her pledge with which she obligated herself and her father says nothing to her, all her vows and every pledge by which she has obligated herself will stand.

30:6 “Suppose she should marry, after her vow or a rash promise of her lips by which she obligated herself.

30:8 But if her husband should hear about it and on the day he hears it he forbids it, he thereby nullifies her vow and her rash promise by which her lips have obligated her, and </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
30:9 “Any vow or obligation of a widow or a divorced woman will be binding on her.

30:13 Her husband may ratify or veto any vow or sworn oath to deny herself. 
30:14 “But if her husband says nothing to her from day to day, then he is confirming all her vows and all her oaths that are on her. He confirms them by saying nothing to her on the day of his hearing about it.

30:16 These are the statutes that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
31:1  spoke to Moses saying,

31:9  also captured women and sons of Midian, along with all their herds and flocks, and plundered all their goods. 
31:10 They burned with fire all the Midianite cities, settlements, as well as all their camps. 
31:11 They seized all the plunder and all the spoil, both people and animals.

31:19 “Any of you who has killed anyone or touched the body of anyone who has been killed must stay outside the camp for seven days. You must purify yourselves, on the third and seventh days—you and your captives. 
31:20 Also purify every item of clothing as well as every item made of leather or wood.” 
31:21 Eleazar said to the men of the army who had gone to war, “This is the regulation of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
31:22 The gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead,

31:24 You are to wash your clothes also on the seventh day. You will then be clean and may then come into the camp.”

32:31 The sons of Gad and Reuben answered saying, “What </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
32:32 We will cross fully armed before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
32:33 Moses then gave to them—the sons of Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, son of Joseph—the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan—the land with its cities and the territory around the cities. 
32:34 The sons of Gad built up Dibon, Ataroth and Aroer, 
32:35 as well as Atroh-shophan, Jazer and Jogbehah, 
32:36 Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran as fortified cities, as well as sheep pens. 
32:37 The sons of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 
32:38 Nebo, Baal Meon, (cities whose names were changed) and Sibmah. They gave other names to the rebuilt cities. 
32:39 The sons of Machir son of Manasseh went up to Gilead, captured it, and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
32:40 So Moses gave Gilead to Machir son of Manasseh, and he lived there. 
32:41 Jair, a son of Manasseh, went and captured their settlements and named them Jair’s Villages. 
32:42 Nobah went and conquered Kenath and its settlements and named them Nobah after his own name.

33:49 They camped along the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth to Abel-shittim. 
33:50  spoke to Moses along the Jordan in the plains of Moab across from Jericho saying, 
33:51 “Speak to </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
33:52 You must drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you. You must destroy all their idols and cast images, and demolish their high places. 
33:53 You will take possession of the land, so you will settle in it, because I have given it to you to possess. 
33:54 “You are to divide the land by lot according to your families. To the large, make their inheritance larger, and to the small, make their inheritance smaller. Whatever comes out of the lot will be theirs. You are to distribute the inheritance according to your ancestral tribes. 
33:55 “But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, whoever you allow to remain will become to you barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will give you trouble in the land in which you will be living. 
33:56 Then what I had intended to do to them, I will do to you.”
34:1  spoke to Moses saying, 
34:2 “Command </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
34:3 Your southern side will run from the wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom to the southern end of the Dead Sea on the east. 
34:4 Your border will cross south of the Scorpion Pass and continue to Zin and south of Kadesh-barnea, then go on to Hazar-addar and on to Azmon. 
34:5 Then the border will turn from Azmon to the Wadi of Egypt and end at the sea. 
34:6 “Your western boundary will be the coast of the Great Sea. This will be your western border. 
34:7 “Your northern boundary will be by running a line from the Great Sea to Mount Hor, 
34:8 then from Mount Hor to Levo-Hamath , then the boundary will go to Zedad. 
34:9 The border will continue on to Ziphron, ending at Hazar-Enan. This will be your northern border. 
34:10 “For your eastern border, run a line from Hazar-Enan to Shepham. 
34:11 From Shepham, the boundary will descend to Riblah on the east side of Ain, continuing along the eastern slopes of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Kinneret
34:12 From there the border will go down along the Jordan, ending at the Dead Sea. This will be your territory with its surrounding borders.” 
34:13 Moses commanded </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
34:14 For the tribe of the sons of Reuben by their ancestral houses, the tribe of the sons of Gad by their ancestral houses, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance. 
34:15 These two and a half tribes have received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan at Jericho, toward the sunrise.” 
34:16  spoke to Moses saying, 
34:17 “These are the names of the men who will allot the land to you: Eleazar the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
34:18 Also you are to select one prince from each tribe to allot the land. 
34:19 These are their names: from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh. 
34:20 From the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Shemuel son of Ammihud. 
34:21 From the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad son of Chislon. 
34:22 From the tribe of the sons of Dan, the prince is Bukki son of Jogli. 
34:23 From the sons of Joseph, from the tribe of the sons of Manasseh, the prince is to be Hanniel son of Ephod. 
34:24 The prince from the tribe of the sons of Ephraim is to be Kemuel son of Shiphtan. 
34:25 “The prince from the tribe of the sons of Zebulun is Elizaphan son of Parnach. 
34:26 The prince from the tribe of the sons of Issachar is Paltiel son of Azzan. 
34:27 The prince from the tribe of the sons of Asher is Ahihud son of Shelomi.

35:3 Thus they will have cities to live in and pastures for their cattle, flocks and all their livestock. 
35:4 The pastures you give the Levites will extend out from the walls around the cities for 1,000 cubits. 
35:5 You are to measure outside the cities 2,000 cubits on the east side, 2,000 cubits on the south side, on the west side 2,000 cubits, and on the north side 2,000 cubits. These are to be pasturelands for the cities. 
35:6 “Six of the cities you give the Levites are to be cities of refuge, to which anyone who kills anyone may flee. Besides these, you are to give the Levites 42 more cities. 
35:7 In all, you are to give the Levites 48 cities with their pastures.

35:11 You are to select cities which will be cities of refuge, to which one might flee if he has killed someone by accident. 
35:12 They are to be cities for refuge from the avenger, so the manslayer may not die before standing trial before the assembly. 
35:13 The six cities you designate are to be your cities of refuge. 
35:14 Designate three cities on this side of the Jordan and three in the land of Canaan as cities of refuge. 
35:15 “These six cities of refuge are to be for </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
35:16 Now if the manslayer strikes someone with an iron object so that he dies, he is a murderer and the murderer must die. 
35:17 If anyone has a stone in his hand that could be deadly and strikes anyone with it so that he dies, he is a murderer and the murderer must die. 
35:18 Or if someone has a wooden object that could kill and strikes anyone so that he dies, he is a murderer and the murderer must be put to death. 
35:19 The blood avenger himself may put the murderer to death. When he finds him, he is to kill him. 
35:20 “If anyone pushes someone maliciously, or throws anything at him with deadly intent, 
35:21 or with hostility hits him with his fist so that he dies, the one hitting him is a murderer. The blood avenger may put the murderer to death when he finds him. 
35:22 But if he pushes him suddenly or throws an object at him with no intent, 
35:23 or without seeing him should drop a stone on him resulting in his death, but he was not his enemy and intended him no harm, 
35:24 the assembly must judge between the manslayer and the avenger of blood according to these regulations. 
35:25 The assembly must protect the manslayer from the avenger of blood. The assembly should send him back to the city of refuge to which he had fled and he is to remain there until the death of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen gadol

35:29 “These are to be statutes of justice for your generations in all your dwelling places. 
35:30 Everyone killing anyone shall be put to death as a murderer only on the testimony of more than one witness. No one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness. 
35:31 “You are not to accept ransom for the life of a murderer. He deserves to die and he is to die.
