1:1 What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the Word of life—
1:2 the life was revealed, and we have seen and testify and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us. 
1:3 What we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so you may have fellowship with us. Indeed, our fellowship is with the Father and His Son, </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Yeshua
1:4 These things we write so our joy may be full.
1:5 Now this is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you—that God is light and in Him there is no darkness at all. 
1:6 If we say we have fellowship with Him and keep walking in the darkness, we are lying and do not practice the truth. 
1:7 But if we walk in the light as He Himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of His Son </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Yeshua
1:8 If we say we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. 
1:9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 
1:10 If we say we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us. 
2:1 My children, I am writing these things to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an Intercessor with the Father—the righteous Messiah </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Yeshua
2:2 He is the atonement for our sins, and not only for our sins but also for the whole world.
2:3 Now we know that we have come to know Him by this—if we keep His commandments. 
2:4 The one who says, “I have come to know Him,” and does not keep His commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 
2:5 But whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God is truly made perfect. We know that we are in Him by this— 
2:6 whoever claims to abide in Him must walk just as He walked.
2:7 Loved ones, I am not writing a new commandment for you, but an old commandment—one you had from the beginning. This old commandment is the word you have heard. 
2:8 Yet I am writing a new commandment for you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is fading and the true light is already shining. 
2:9 The one who says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in the darkness. 
2:10 The one who loves his brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling. 
2:11 But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness. He doesn’t know where he is going, because the darkness has made his eyes blind. 
2:12 I am writing to you, children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of His name. 
2:13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you have known the One who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. 
2:14 I have written to you, children, because you have known the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you have known the One who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one. 
2:15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 
2:16 For everything in the world—the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eyes, and the boasting of life—is not from the Father but from the world. 
2:17 The world is passing away along with its desire, but the one who does the will of God abides forever.
2:18 Children, it is the last hour. Just as you heard that the anti-messiah is coming, even now many anti-messiahs have come—by this we know that it is the last hour. 
2:19 They left us, but they didn’t really belong to us. If they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But they left us so it became clear that none of them belongs to us. 
2:20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know. 
2:21 I have not written you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie is of the truth.
2:22 Who is the liar, if not the one who denies that </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Yeshua
2:23 No one who denies the Son has the Father; the one who acknowledges the Son also has the Father. 
2:24 As for you, let what you heard from the beginning remain in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will continue to live in the Son and in the Father. 
2:25 Now this is the promise that He Himself has promised us—eternal life. 
2:26 I have written you these things about those who are trying to mislead you. 
2:27 As for you, the anointing you received from Him remains in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you. But as His anointing teaches you about all things—and it is true and not a lie—and just as it has taught you, abide in Him. 
2:28 And now, children, abide in Him, so that when He appears we will have confidence and not be ashamed in His presence at His coming.
2:29 If you know that He is righteous, you also know that everyone who does what is right is born of Him. 
3:1 See how glorious a love the Father has given us, that we should be called God’s children—and so we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know Him. 
3:2 Loved ones, now we are God’s children; and it has not yet been revealed what we will be. But we do know that when it’s revealed, we shall be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is. 
3:3 Everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure. 
3:4 Everyone practicing sin also practices lawlessness—indeed, sin is lawlessness. 
3:5 You know that </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Yeshua
3:6 No one who abides in Him keeps on sinning; no one who sins has seen Him or known Him. 
3:7 Children, let no one mislead you! The one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Yeshua
3:8 The one who practices sin is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ben-Elohim
3:9 No one born of God practices sin, because God’s seed remains in him. He cannot sin, because he is born of God.
3:10 It is clear who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil by this—anyone who does not act righteously or love his brother is not of God. 
3:11 For this is the message you have heard from the beginning—we should love one another. 
3:12 Do not be like Cain, who was from the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his deeds were evil, while his brother’s were righteous. 
3:13 Do not be surprised, brothers and sisters, if the world hates you. 
3:14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers and sisters. The one who does not love remains in death. 
3:15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer—and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 
3:16 We have come to know love by this—</span><span class="it"><span class="content">Yeshua
3:17 But if someone has material possessions and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him? 
3:18 Children, let us not love with word or talk, but in deed and truth! 
3:19 By this we shall know that we are of the truth, and set our heart at rest before Him 
3:20 whenever our heart condemns us. For God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. 
3:21 Loved ones, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; 
3:22 and whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do what is pleasing in His sight. 
3:23 Now this is His commandment—that we should believe in the name of His Son, </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Yeshua
3:24 The one who keeps His commandments abides in God, and God in him. We know that He abides in us by this—by the Spirit He has given us.
4:1 Loved ones, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are from God. For many false prophets have gone out into the world. 
4:2 You know the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach Elohim
4:3 but every spirit that does not acknowledge </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Yeshua
4:4 You are from God, children, and you have overcome them, because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world. 
4:5 They are from the world, so they speak from the world and the world listens to them. 
4:6 We are from God; whoever knows God listens to us, but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
4:7 Loved ones, let us love one another, for love is from God. Everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. 
4:8 The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love. 
4:9 The love of God was revealed among us by this—that God sent His one and only Son into the world so that we might live through Him. 
4:10 This is love—not that we have loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as an atonement for our sins. 
4:11 Loved ones, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 
4:12 No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God abides in us and His love is made perfect in us. 
4:13 We know that we abide in Him and He in us by this—because He has given us of His Spirit. 
4:14 We have seen and testify that the Father has sent His Son as Savior of the world. 
4:15 If anyone acknowledges that </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Yeshua
4:16 So we have come to know and trust in the love that God has for us. God is love. Now whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. 
4:17 In this way, love is made perfect among us, so that we should have boldness on the Day of Judgment. For just as He is, so also are we in this world. 
4:18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and the one who fears has not been made perfect in love. 
4:19 We love, because He first loved us. 
4:20 If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar. For the one who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. 
4:21 And this commandment we have from Him: that the one who loves God should also love his brother. 
5:1 Everyone who believes that </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Yeshua
5:2 We know that we love God’s children by this—when we love God and obey His commandments. 
5:3 For this is the love of God—that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome. 
5:4 For everyone born of God overcomes the world. And the victory that has overcome the world is this—our faith. 
5:5 Who is it that overcomes the world, if not the one who believes that </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Yeshua
5:6 Messiah </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Yeshua
5:7 For there are three that testify— 
5:8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood—and these three are one. 
5:9 If we accept men’s testimony, God’s testimony is greater—for this it is the testimony that God has given about His Son. 
5:10 The one who trusts in </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ben-Elohim
5:11 And the testimony is this—that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. 
5:12 The one who has the Son has life; the one who does not have </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ben-Elohim
5:13 I wrote these things to you who believe in the name of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ben-Elohim
5:14 Now this is the confidence we have before Him—that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. 
5:15 And if we know that He hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have the requests we have asked from Him. 
5:16 If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he should ask, and God will give life to those who commit sin not leading to death. There is a sin leading to death—I am not saying you should ask about that. 
5:17 All unrighteousness is sin, but there is sin not leading to death. 
5:18 We know that anyone born of God does not keep on sinning; rather, the One born of God keeps him safe, and the evil one cannot touch him. 
5:19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. 
5:20 And we know that </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ben-Elohim
5:21 Children, guard yourselves from idols.
