1:1 In the thirtieth year on the fifth day of the fourth month, as I was among the exiles by the river Chebar, the heavens opened, and I saw visions of God.
1:2 In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity,
1:3 the word of Adonai came to Ezekiel the kohen, son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar. (The hand of Adonai was upon him there.)
1:4 I looked, and behold, a storm wind came from the north, a great cloud with flashing fire and brightness all around it, and something like a glowing alloy out of the fire.
1:5 From within it came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: they had a likeness of a human,
1:6 but each one had four faces and each one of them had four wings.
1:7 Their legs were straight and the soles of their feet were like the hoof of a calf. They sparkled like the color of burnished bronze.
1:8 They had human hands under their wings on their four sides. The four of them had faces and wings:
1:9 their wings touched one another; they did not turn when they moved; each could move in the direction of any of its faces.
1:10 As for the form of their faces, each had a human face, the four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face of an ox on the left side and the four had the face of an eagle.
1:11 Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above. Each creature had two wings touching the wing of another, while another two were covering their bodies.
1:12 Now each being could move in the direction of any of its faces; wherever the Ruach would go, they went, without turning as they went.
1:13 As for the form of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, resembling torches moving between the living creatures. There was brightness to the fire, and lightning went forth from the fire.
1:14 The living creatures were running back and forth like flashes of lightning.
1:15 As I looked at the living creatures, behold, one wheel was on the ground next to each of the four-faced creatures.
1:16 The appearance and structure of the wheels was like the gleaming of beryl. The four had the same likeness, their appearance and their structure seemed to be a wheel within a wheel.
1:17 When they went, they went in any of their four directions without pivoting as they went.
1:18 Their rims were high and awesome—all four rims were full of eyes all around.
1:19 When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them. When the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose.
1:20 Wherever the Ruach wanted to go, they went, in the direction the Ruach wanted to go. The wheels rose along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
1:21 Whenever the creatures went, the wheels went. When the creatures stood still, these wheels stood still. When the creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
1:22 Now over the heads of the living creatures there was something like an expanse, shining like the color of ice, stretched forth over their heads.
1:23 Under the expanse, their wings were stretched out straight, one toward the other. Each had another pair covering its body.
1:24 When they moved, I could hear the sound of their wings like the sound of rushing waters, like the voice of Shaddai, a noise of tumult like the noise of an army. Whenever they stood still, they let down their wings.
1:25 There came a voice from above the expanse over their heads. Whenever they stood still, they let down their wings.
1:26 Above the expanse over their heads was something like a throne, resembling a sapphire stone. Above the shape of the throne was a figure of human appearance.
1:27 From what appeared as his waist upward, I saw a glowing metal, looking like a fire encased in a frame. From what was like his waist down, I saw the appearance of fire radiating around him.
1:28 Like the appearance of the rainbow in the cloud on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the radiance. It was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Adonai. I saw it, fell upon my face, and heard the voice of the One who was speaking.
2:1 Then He said to me: “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.”
2:2 As He spoke to me, the Ruach came upon me and stood me up on my feet. I heard Him speaking to me again.
2:3 He said to me, “Son of man, I send you to Bnei-Yisrael, to rebellious nations that have been rebelling against Me. They and their fathers have rebelled against Me to this very day.
2:4 The children have hard faces and stubborn hearts. I am sending you to them, and you are to tell them, ‘Thus says Adonai Elohim.’
2:5 Whether they listen, or whether they will refuse to listen—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a prophet was among them.
2:6 “But you, son of man, do not be afraid of them. Do not fear their words, though thistles and thorns are beside you and you sit among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words or be dismayed by their looks—for they are a rebellious house.
2:7 You will speak My words to them, whether they will listen or whether they will refuse to listen—for they are rebellious.
2:8 Now you, son of man, hear what I say to you: do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth, and eat what I am giving to you.”
2:9 I looked, and behold, a hand was stretched out to me, holding a written scroll.
2:10 He spread it out before me. It was written on, front and back. Written on it were lamentations, dirges and woe.
3:1 Then He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find—eat this scroll. Then go, speak to the house of Israel.”
3:2 So I opened my mouth, and He gave me that scroll to eat,
3:3 as He said to me, “Son of man, feed your belly with this scroll that I am giving you and fill your stomach with it.” I ate it and it tasted as sweet as honey.
3:4 Then He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak My words to them.
3:5 For you are not sent to a people of unintelligible speech and difficult tongue, but to the house of Israel,
3:6 nor to many peoples of unintelligible speech or difficult tongue, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to such, they would listen to you.
3:7 But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to Me. Surely the whole house of Israel has a hard forehead and a stubborn heart.
3:8 Look, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.
3:9 I will make your forehead like adamant, harder than flint. Do not fear them. Do not be dismayed by their faces, for they are a rebellious house.”
3:10 Furthermore, He said to me: “Son of man, receive in your heart and hear with your ears all My words that I will speak to you.
3:11 Go to the exiles, to the children of your people. Speak to them. Tell them, ‘Thus says Adonai Elohim.’ Whether they will listen or whether they will refuse to listen.”
3:12 Then the Ruach lifted me up. I heard behind me the sound of a great earthquake—“Blessed is the glory of Adonai from His place!”—
3:13 also the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, the sound of the wheels beside them and the sound of a great earthquake.
3:14 The Ruach lifted me up and took me away. I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit. The hand of Adonai was strong upon me.
3:15 I came to the exiles at Tel-Abib who lived by the river Chebar. I sat where they were dwelling. I sat there overwhelmed among them for seven days.
3:16 Now at the end of seven days, the word of Adonai came to me saying:
3:17 “Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for the house of Israel. When you hear a word from My mouth, give them a warning from Me.
3:18 When I say to the wicked, ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn him or speak to warn the wicked of his wicked way, to save his life, that wicked person will die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood from your hand.
3:19 Yet you, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul.
3:20 When a righteous person turns from his righteousness and acts perversely, I will lay a stumbling block before him and he will die. Because you have not warned him, he will die in his sin. His righteous deeds that he has done will not be remembered—but I will require his blood at your hand.
3:21 If you warn the righteous person not to sin and the righteous person does not sin, he will surely live, because he took warning. You will have delivered your soul.”
3:22 The hand of Adonai came upon me there. He said to me: “Arise, go out to the valley. I will speak with you there.”
3:23 So I arose, and went out to the valley. Behold, the glory of Adonai stood there—like the glory that I saw by the River Chebar—and I fell on my face.
3:24 The Ruach came into me, and stood me upon my feet. Then He spoke with me and said to me: “Go, shut yourself in your house.
3:25 You, son of man, behold, ropes will be put on you. You will be bound with them, so that you cannot go out among the people.
3:26 I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth. You will be mute and unable to reprove them, for they are a rebellious house.
3:27 But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth. You will say to them: ‘Thus says Adonai Elohim.’ he that hears, let him hear. He that refuses to hear, let him refuse—for they are a rebellious house.”
4:1 “Now you, son of man, take a brick and lay it before you. Engrave on it a city, Jerusalem.
4:2 Lay siege against it, build earthworks against it, raise an assault ramp against it; pitch camps against it and place battering rams all around it.
4:3 Then take an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between you and the city. Set your face toward it so that it is under siege. So you will lay siege against it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.
4:4 “Then you are to lie on your left side, and set on it the punishment of the house of Israel; according to the number of days that you lie on it, you will bear their iniquity.
4:5 I have appointed the years of their punishment to you as a number of days—390 days. So you will bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
4:6 When you have completed these, you will lie on your right side and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah—40 days—a day for each year, I have appointed to you.
4:7 You will set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm bared, and prophesy against it.
4:8 “Behold, I will put ropes upon you. You will not be able to turn from side to side until you have completed the days of your siege.
4:9 Take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and rye, and put them in one bowl. You will make bread from them for the number of days that you will lie on your side; for 390 days, you will eat it.
4:10 The food that you will eat will be 20 shekels a day by weight. You may eat from it from time to time.
4:11 You are also to drink water by measure, a sixth of a hin. You may drink it from time to time.
4:12 Eat it as barley cakes. Bake it on human dung before their eyes.”
4:13 Then Adonai said, “This is how Bnei-Yisrael will eat their bread—unclean, among the nations where I will scatter them.”
4:14 Then I said, “Ah, Adonai Elohim ! Behold, I have never defiled myself. From my youth up until now have I not eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts. Tainted meat has never come into my mouth.”
4:15 He said to me, “See, I have given you cow dung instead of human dung. So you will prepare your bread on it.”
4:16 Then he said to me, “Son of man, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. They will eat bread by weight, in anxiety, and they will drink water by measure, in horror.
4:17 On account of their lack of bread and water they will be appalled at one another and waste away in their iniquity.
5:1 “Now you, son of man, take a sharp sword. Use it as a barber’s razor to shave your head and your beard. Then take balances to weigh and divide the hair.
5:2 A third you will burn in fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are complete. Take a third and strike it with the sword all around the city. Scatter a third to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.
5:3 Take a few from there and tie them up in your garment.
5:4 Again take some of them, throw them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire. A fire will spread from it into all the house of Israel.”
5:5 Thus says Adonai Elohim: “This is Jerusalem! I have set her in the midst of the nations, with countries all around her.
5:6 She has rebelled against My ordinances by doing wickedness worse than the nations, and against My decrees worse than the surrounding countries. For they have rejected My ordinances and as for My decrees, they have not walked in them.”
5:7 Therefore thus says Adonai Elohim: “Because you are more turbulent than the surrounding nations, in that you have not walked in My decrees or followed my ordinances, nor have you observed the ordinances of the surrounding nations,
5:8 therefore thus says Adonai Elohim: Behold, I in turn am against you. I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations.
5:9 On account of your abominations I will do with you that which I have never done, and the like of which I would never do again.
5:10 Therefore the fathers will eat the sons in your midst, and sons will eat their fathers. I will execute judgments on you and I will scatter the remainder of you to all the winds.
5:11 “Therefore, as I live, says Adonai Elohim, surely, because you have defiled My Sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations, therefore I will shave you off. My eye will not spare, and I will have no pity.
5:12 A third of you will die with the plague and will be consumed with famine in your midst. A third will fall by the sword all around you. A third I will scatter to all the winds, and draw out a sword after them.
5:13 I will vent all My anger and satisfy My fury on them. Then I will rest. So they will know that I, Adonai, have spoken in My zeal, when I have satisfied My fury on them.
5:14 “Moreover I will make you a ruin and a mockery among the surrounding nations and in the sight of all who pass by.
5:15 When I execute judgment upon you in anger, rage and furious chastisement, you will be a mockery and a taunt, a warning and a horror to the surrounding nations: I, Adonai, have spoken it.
5:16 When I send evil arrows of famine upon them, for destruction I will send them to destroy you, and I will intensify the famine upon you and will break your staff of bread.
5:17 I will send on you famine and evil beasts, and they will make you childless. Plague and blood will sweep through you. I will bring the sword upon you. I, Adonai, have spoken.”
6:1 The word of Adonai came to me saying:
6:2 “Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy to them.
6:3 Say: mountains of Israel, hear the word of Adonai!” Thus says Adonai Elohim concerning the mountains and concerning the hills, concerning the wadis and concerning the valleys: “Behold, I will bring a sword on you. I will destroy your high places.
6:4 Your altars will become desolate. Your sun pillars will be broken. I will cast down your slain men before your idols.
6:5 I will lay the corpses of Bnei-Yisrael before their idols. I will scatter your bones around your altars.
6:6 In all your dwellings the cities will be desolate. The high places will be deserted. Your altars will be laid waste and made desolate, your idols broken and destroyed, your sun pillars cut down and your works blotted out.
6:7 The slain will fall in your midst. Then you will know that I am Adonai.
6:8 “Yet I will leave a remnant, some that escape the sword among the nations, when you have been scattered through the countries.
6:9 The survivors will remember Me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I was crushed by their adulterous heart that has strayed from Me and their eyes which have lusted after their idols. They will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils that they committed in all their abominations.
6:10 They will know that I am Adonai. I have not warned in vain that I would do this evil to them.”
6:11 Thus says Adonai Elohim: “Clap your hands, stamp your foot and cry, ‘Alas!’ because of all the vile abominations of the house of Israel who will fall by the sword, by famine and by plague.
6:12 The one who is far off will die of the plague; the one who is near will fall by the sword. Whoever remains and is spared will die by the famine; this is how I will spend My fury on them.
6:13 You will know that I am Adonai, when your slain lie among their idols surrounding their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree and under every leafy oak—the places where they offer sweet aroma to all their idols.
6:14 I will stretch out My hand over them and make the land desolate and waste, more than the wilderness of Diblah, wherever they live. Then they will know that I am Adonai.”
7:1 The word of Adonai came to me saying:
7:2 “You, son of man, thus says Adonai Elohim concerning the land of Israel: An end! The end has come on the four corners of the land.
7:3 The end is upon you. I will send My anger on you. I will judge you according to your ways. I will bring all your abominations on you.
7:4 My eyes will not spare you nor will I have pity, but I will bring your ways upon you, for your abominations in your midst. Then you will know that I am Adonai.”
7:5 Thus says Adonai Elohim: An evil, a singular evil, behold, it comes.
7:6 An end has come, the end has come! It has awakened against you. Look, it is coming!
7:7 Doom has come upon you, inhabitant of the land! The time has come, the day is near—panic, not joyful shouting on the hills.
7:8 Now, soon, I am about to pour out My fury on you. I will exhaust My anger on you. I will judge you according to your ways. I will bring all your abominations on you.
7:9 My eye will not spare you nor will I have pity—I will repay you for your ways—your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that it is I, Adonai, who strikes.
7:10 Behold, the day! Look, it is coming! Doom has gone out. The rod has budded, arrogance has blossomed.
7:11 Violence grows into a rod of wickedness. Nothing will come from them, nothing from their crowd, nothing from their tumult, nothing distinctive among them.
7:12 The time has come—the day draws near. The buyer will not rejoice, the seller will not play the mourner, for wrath is on the entire crowd.
7:13 For a seller will not regain what he sold, as long as they are alive. For the vision against her whole crowd will not be revoked. No one will preserve his life, because of his iniquity.
7:14 “They have blown the horn. They have made everyone ready. Yet no one goes to the battle. Surely My wrath is on her whole crowd.
7:15 Outside is the sword, inside plague and famine. Whoever is in the field will die by the sword. Whoever is in the city will be devoured by famine and plague.
7:16 Those survivors who escape will head for the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each one over his iniquity.
7:17 All hands will be feeble. All knees will turn to water.
7:18 They will also gird on sackcloth. Horror will cover them. Shame will be upon all faces. Baldness will be upon all their heads.
7:19 They will throw their silver in the streets. Their gold will be as garbage. Their silver and their gold cannot deliver them in the day of Adonai’s wrath. They will not satisfy their appetite or fill their bellies, for their iniquity is a stumbling block.
7:20 They took pride in their beautiful jewelry and made images of their abominations and their detestable idols. Therefore I made it niddah to them.
7:21 I will give it into the hands of the strangers as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as spoil, and they will profane it.
7:22 I will turn My face from them, as they will profane the place I treasure. Robbers will enter it and profane it.
7:23 “Forge the chain! For the land is full of bloodshed. The city is full of violence.
7:24 I will bring the wicked of the nations. They will possess their houses. So I will end the pride of the strong, when their holy places are profaned.
7:25 Shuddering comes. They will seek peace but there will be none.
7:26 Disaster upon disaster will come, and rumor upon rumor. They will seek a vision from a prophet, but Torah will perish from the kohen and counsel from the elders.
7:27 The king will mourn. The prince will be clothed with despair. The hands of the people of the land will tremble. By their conduct I will deal with them. By their own standards I will judge them. Then they will know that I am Adonai.”
8:1 In the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month, I was sitting in my house. The elders of Judah were sitting before me. There the hand of Adonai fell on me.
8:2 I looked, and behold, a form resembling fire—from the appearance of his waist downward, fire; and from his loins and waist upward, something like the appearance of brightness, as glowing metal.
8:3 Something like the form of a hand stretched out, and took me by the hair of my head. The Ruach lifted me up between the earth and the heaven. He brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court facing north—where the idol that provokes furious jealousy was.
8:4 Behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the valley.
8:5 He said to me: “Son of man, lift your eyes toward the north.” So I lifted up my eyes toward the north. Behold, north of the gate of the altar, was this image provoking jealousy in the entrance.
8:6 He said to me: “Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel is committing here, that drives me far off from My own Sanctuary? But you will see even greater abominations.”
8:7 He brought me to the door of the court. When I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.
8:8 Then He said to me, “Son of man, now dig through the wall.” When I had dug through the wall, there was a door.
8:9 He said to me: “Go and see the wicked abominations that they do here.”
8:10 So I went in and saw, behold, every detestable image of creeping things and beasts and all the idols of the house of Israel, engraved on the surrounding walls.
8:11 Standing there before them were 70 men of the elders of the house of Israel, Jaazaniah son of Shaphan standing in their midst, each man with his censer in his hand. A thick cloud of incense went up.
8:12 Then He said to me: “Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his chamber of his carved idol? For they say, ‘Adonai does not see us. Adonai has forsaken the land.’”
8:13 He said further to me, “You will see still greater abominations that they are doing.”
8:14 He brought me to the door of the gate of Adonai’s House, which was toward the north. Behold, the women sat there weeping for Tammuz.
8:15 He said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? You will again see even greater abominations than these.”
8:16 So He brought me into the inner court of Adonai’s House. Behold, at the door of the Temple of Adonai, between the porch and the altar, were about 25 men, with their backs toward the Temple of Adonai and their faces toward the east—and they were bowing in worship eastward toward the sun.
8:17 He said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it too light a thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations they practice here, that they must also fill the land with violence and provoke Me still more? Look, they are putting the twig to My nose!
8:18 Therefore I will indeed act in fury. My eye will not spare you nor will I have pity. Though they cry into My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.”
9:1 Then He called into my ears in a loud voice saying: “Bring near the executioners of the city, each with his weapon of destruction in his hand.”
9:2 Behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, facing north, each with his war club in his hand. One man among them, clothed in linen, had a scribe’s writing case at his side. They went in and stood beside the bronze altar.
9:3 Then the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cheruv, where it had been, to the threshold of the House. He called to the man clothed in linen, who had the scribe’s inkhorn at his side.
9:4 Adonai said to him, “Go throughout the city, through the midst of Jerusalem. Make a mark on the foreheads of the people who sigh and moan over all the abominations that are committed in it.”
9:5 To the others He said in my hearing: “Go through the city after him and strike. Show no pity or compassion;
9:6 kill off old men, young men and girls, little children and women. But touch no one who has the mark. Begin at My Sanctuary.” Then they began with the elders who were before the House.
9:7 He said to them, “Defile the House and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!” So they went out and began to kill in the city.
9:8 While they were out killing, and I was left alone, I fell on my face and cried out saying, “Alas, Adonai Elohim! Are you going to destroy all the remnant of Israel by pouring out Your wrath upon Jerusalem?”
9:9 He said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is very, very great; the land is full of blood and the city is full of corruption. For they say, ‘Adonai has forsaken the land, Adonai does not see!’
9:10 As for Me, my eye will not show pity nor will I spare. I will bring their conduct upon their head.”
9:11 Behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn at his side, reported saying, “I have done just as You have commanded me.”
10:1 Then I looked, and behold, above the expanse over the heads of the cheruvim, there appeared above them something like a sapphire stone, resembling a throne.
10:2 He spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, “Go in between the whirling wheels underneath the cheruvim. Fill your hands with glowing coals from between the cheruvim and scatter them over the city.” So he went in before my eyes.
10:3 Now the cheruvim stood on the right side of the House when the man went in. The cloud filled the inner court.
10:4 Then the glory of Adonai rose up from above the cheruv to the threshold of the House. The House was filled with the cloud and the court was full of the brilliance of Adonai’s glory.
10:5 The sound of the wings of the cheruvim was heard as far as the outer court, as the voice of El Shaddai when He speaks.
10:6 After He commanded the man clothed in linen saying: “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cheruvim,” he went in and stood beside a wheel.
10:7 The cheruv reached out his hand from between the cheruvim into the fire that was between the cheruvim and took some of it. He put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
10:8 The cheruvim appeared to have the form of a human hand under their wings.
10:9 Then I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cheruvim, one wheel beside one cheruv, and another wheel beside another cheruv. The appearance of the wheels was like the sparkling of a beryl stone.
10:10 As for their appearance, the four had one form—like a wheel within a wheel.
10:11 When they went, they would go in any of their four directions, without pivoting as they went. So to whatever place the head faced, they followed, without turning as they went.
10:12 Their whole body, their backs, their hands, their wings, and their wheels, the wheels of the four of them, were full of eyes all around.
10:13 As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing “the whirling wheels.”
10:14 Each one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cheruv, the second face was the face of a man, the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle.
10:15 The cheruvim arose—these were the living creatures that I saw by the river Chebar.
10:16 As the cheruvim went, the wheels would go beside them. When the cheruvim lifted up their wings to rise from the earth, the wheels would not turn from beside them.
10:17 When they stood still, these stood still. When they rose up, these rose up with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in them.
10:18 Then the glory of Adonai went forth from above the threshold of the House and stood above the cheruvim.
10:19 The cheruvim lifted up their wings and arose from the earth in my sight. When they went out, the wheels went with them. They stood still at the door of the east gate of Adonai’s House. The glory of the God of Israel was over them from above.
10:20 They were the living creatures that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar. I knew that they were cheruvim.
10:21 Each of them had four faces and each one four wings. The appearance of human hands was under their wings.
10:22 As for the appearance of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance I saw by the river Chebar. Each could move in the direction of any of its faces.
11:1 Then the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
11:2 He said to me, “Son of man, these are the men that devise sin and give wicked counsel in this city,
11:3 who say, ‘This is not the time to build houses! This city is the cooking pot and we are the meat!’
11:4 Therefore, prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man.”
11:5 Then the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
11:6 You have multiplied your slain in this city and you filled the streets with corpses.”
11:7 Therefore, thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:8 You feared the sword, so I will bring the sword against you.” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:9 “I will bring you out of the midst of it, give you into the hands of strangers and execute judgments against you.

11:13 As I prophesied, Pelatiah son of Benaiah dropped dead. I fell upon my face and cried out with a loud voice and said, “Ah, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

11:18 When they come there, they will remove all of its detestable things and all of its abominations.
11:19 Then I will give them one heart. I will put a new Spirit within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,
11:20 so that they may follow My laws, keep My ordinances and practice them. They will be My people and I will be their God.
11:21 As for those whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and abominations, I will bring their ways upon their heads.” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

12:2 “Son of man, you live in the midst of the rebellious house. They have eyes to see, but do not see, ears to hear, but do not hear, for they are a rebellious house.
12:3 You, son of man, prepare supplies for exile. Go into exile by day in their sight, go away as if into exile from your home to another place in their sight—perhaps they will recognize that they are a rebellious house.
12:4 You will bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile. You will go out at evening in their sight, like those going into exile.
12:5 As they watch, dig through the wall and go out through it.
12:6 Bear the burden on your shoulder in their sight. Carry it out in the darkness; cover your face so that you cannot see the ground. For I have made you a sign for the house of Israel.”
12:7 I did just as I was commanded: I brought out my baggage by day, as baggage for exile. In the evening, I dug through the wall with my hand. I carried it out in the darkness and bore it on my shoulder, as they watched.
12:8 In the morning, the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
12:9 “Son of man, has the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’

12:11 Say, ‘I am a sign for you. Just as I have done, so it will be done to them—they will go into exile, into captivity.
12:12 The prince who is among them will bear a burden on his shoulder, and go out in the darkness. They will dig through the wall to get out; he will cover his face so that he cannot see the land with his eyes.
12:13 I will spread out My net upon him, so he will be caught in My net. I will bring him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans. He will not see it, though he will die there.
12:14 I will disperse toward every wind all that surround him to help him and all his troops. I will draw out the sword after them.
12:15 So they will know that I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

15:5 Look, when it was whole, it was not useful for any work—how much less, when the fire has devoured it and it is charred, will it be useful for any work?

16:4 As for your birth, on the day you were born your umbilical cord was not cut nor were you washed in water for cleansing. You were never rubbed with salt nor were you swaddled at all.
16:5 No eye pitied you enough to do any of these things to you out of compassion. Instead you were cast out in the open field, for you were detested on the day you were born.
16:6 “When I passed by you, and saw you kicking in your blood. I said to you, ‘In your blood, live!’ Yes, I said to you, ‘In your blood, live!’
16:7 I made you grow as myriads, like a branch of the field. You grew up, got tall and came to full adornment. Your breasts were formed, your hair sprouted. Yet you were naked and bare.
16:8 “Again I passed by and saw you, and behold, you were truly at the time of love. I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness. I swore to you and entered into a covenant with you,” says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:9 Then I washed you with water, rinsed off your blood from on you and anointed you with oil.

16:11 I adorned you with jewelry, put bracelets on your hands and a necklace on your neck.
16:12 I put a ring in your nose, earrings on your ears and a crown of glory on your head.
16:13 So you were adorned with gold and silver, and your raiment was of fine linen, silk and embroidery. You ate fine flour, honey and oil. You became exceedingly beautiful, and advanced to the kingdom.
16:14 Your fame spread among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect, through My splendor, which I bestowed on you.” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

16:16 You took your garments, made high places decked out with various colors and fornicated on them—this should not happen, it should not be!
16:17 You also took your jewelry—My gold and My silver, which I gave you—made male images for yourself and committed harlotry with them.
16:18 You took your embroidered garments, covered them and placed My oil and My incense before them.
16:19 My bread that I gave you, fine flour, oil and honey that I fed you with, you set before them as a sweet aroma. That is what happened.” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:20 “You took your sons and your daughters whom you bore for Me, and sacrificed them to be eaten by them. Were your obscene practices not enough?
16:21 You slaughtered My children, making them pass through fire for them.
16:22 In all your abominations and harlotry, you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, kicking about in your blood.
16:23 So it was after all your wickedness—oy, oy to you!” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:24 “Then you built a mound for yourself. You made a high place for yourself in every square.
16:25 You built your lofty place at the head of every street. You made your beauty an abomination. You spread your legs for everyone passing by and multiplied your harlotry.
16:26 You committed immorality with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors. You multiplied your prostitution, to provoke Me.
16:27 “So behold, I stretched out My hand over you. I diminished your ration. I gave you over to those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your indecent conduct.
16:28 Then you also played the harlot with the Assyrians, never being satisfied; you played the harlot with them, and still you were not satisfied.
16:29 So you multiplied your harlotry toward the land of merchants—Chaldea—yet even with this, you were not satisfied.
16:30 “How weak is your heart”—it is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:31 when you build your mound at the head of every road and make your high place in every street. Yet you were not like a harlot, since you scoffed at receiving payment.
16:32 You adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband!
16:33 To all prostitutes gifts are given—but you gave your gifts to all your lovers! You bribed them to come to you from every side in your harlotry.
16:34 So you are the opposite of other women—no one runs after you for favors. You give payment and none is given to you. So you are the opposite!
16:35 “Therefore, harlot, hear the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:36 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:37 therefore behold, I will gather all your lovers—those you have pleased and all those you have loved, with all them that you have hated. I will gather them against you from every side. I will expose your nakedness to them, so they may all see your nakedness.
16:38 So I will judge you, as women who commit adultery and shed blood are judged. Then I will bring on you the blood of fury and jealousy.
16:39 I will give you into their hand. They will tear down your mound and break down your high places. They will strip you of your clothes and take your jewelry. They will leave you naked and bare.
16:40 They will also incite an assembly against you, stone you with stones and thrust you through with their swords.
16:41 They will set your houses on fire and execute judgment on you in the sight of many women. So I will cause you to stop your harlotry. You will never again pay for a lover.
16:42 So I will calm My fury against you and My jealousy will turn away from you. Then I will be quiet and angry no longer.
16:43 “Because you did not remember the days of your youth, but have enraged Me in all these things, behold, I will also bring your way on your head”—it is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:44 Behold, everyone who uses proverbs will say this proverb against you, saying, ‘As the mother, so her daughter.’
16:45 You are your mother’s daughter, who despises her husband and her children. You are the sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite. Your father was an Amorite.
16:46 Your elder sister who lives to your left is Samaria, she and her daughters. Your younger sister who lives to your right is Sodom, with her daughters.
16:47 You have not only walked in their ways and gone after their abominations, but in a very short time, you have acted more corruptly than them in all your ways.”
16:48 “As I live”—it is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:49 Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, gluttony, and careless ease—so had she and her daughters—and she did not strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
16:50 So they were haughty and committed abomination before Me; therefore I removed them when I saw it.
16:51 Moreover, Samaria did not commit even half of your sins. You multiplied your abominations beyond theirs. So you made your sisters seem righteous by all your disgusting things you have done.
16:52 You also bear your own shame, since you have interceded for your sisters. Because of your sins that you committed, more treacherous than theirs, they appear more righteous than you. So you also, be ashamed! Bear your disgrace, since you have justified your sisters.
16:53 “I will return their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and along with them, your own captivity.
16:54 So you will bear your own disgrace and be ashamed of all that you have done in becoming a consolation to them.
16:55 Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, Samaria and her daughters, will return to their former state. You and your daughters will return to your former state.
16:56 “Was not your sister Sodom an object of scorn to you in the day of your pride,
16:57 before your own wickedness was exposed? Now you have become an object of scorn for the daughters of Aram and all that surround her, for the daughters of the Philistines, for all around who despise you.
16:58 You will bear your wickedness and your abominations.” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:59 For thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:60 Nevertheless, I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth. Moreover, I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.
16:61 Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed, when you receive your older and younger sisters. I will give them to you for daughters, yet not because of your covenant.
16:62 So I will establish My covenant with you, and you will know that I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:63 So you will remember, be ashamed and never open your mouth again because of your disgrace, when I have forgiven you of all that you have done.” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

17:4 He plucked off its topmost twigs, carried them to the land of trade and set it in a city of merchants.
17:5 Then he took some of the seed of the land and planted it in fruitful soil. He placed it beside abundant waters. He set it like a willow twig.
17:6 Then it sprouted and became a low, spreading vine, with its branches turned toward him, but its roots grew under him. So it became a vine, produced branches and sent out shoots.
17:7 “There was also another great eagle with large wings and many feathers. Behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and shot forth its branches toward him from the bed where it was planted, so that he might water it.
17:8 It was planted in good soil by much water, so it would bring forth branches, bear fruit and be a glorious vine.”
17:9 Say, thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:10 Behold, though planted, will it thrive? Will it not completely wither when the east wind strikes it? In the beds where it grew it will wither.”

17:12 Say now to the rebellious house, “Do you not know what these things mean?” Tell them: “Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, took the king and the princes and brought them with him to Babylon.
17:13 He took one of the royal offspring, cut a covenant with him, putting him under oath. He also took away the leading men of the land,
17:14 so the kingdom might be lowly, not exalting itself, but keeping his covenant so it would hold up.
17:15 “However, he rebelled against him in sending his messengers into Egypt, so they might give him horses and many people. Will he succeed? Will one doing such things escape? Will he break a covenant and escape?
17:16 As I live”—it is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:17 Pharaoh with his mighty army and great throng will be of no help to him in war, when ramps are cast up and siege towers erected, to cut off many lives.
17:18 “Since he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and behold, he had given his hand yet did all these things, he will not escape.
17:19 Therefore thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:20 I will spread My net over him and he will be caught in My snare. Then I will bring him to Babylon, and judge him there for his treachery that he committed against Me.
17:21 All the fugitives of all his armies will fall by the sword. Those that remain will be scattered to every wind. Then you will know that I, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:22 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:23 I will plant it on Israel’s high mountain. It will bring forth branches, bear fruit and be a magnificent cedar. Birds of every kind will nest under it—they will nest in the shade of its branches.

18:7 He does not wrong anyone, returns his pledge for a debt, does not commit robbery, gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment.
18:8 He does not loan with interest or take unjust gain. He keeps his hand from iniquity, executes true justice between people,
18:9 walks in My laws and keeps My statutes, behaving honestly. Such a person is just—he will surely live.” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

18:12 wronged the poor and needy, taken by robbery, not restored the pledge, lifted up his eyes to the idols, committed abomination,

18:14 “Now behold, suppose he fathers a son who sees all his father’s sins that he committed, and observing, does not do likewise.
18:15 He does not eat at mountain shrines, or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbor’s wife,
18:16 nor does he wrong anyone, take pledged property or commit robbery, but he gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,
18:17 withholds his hand from mistreating the poor, does not take interest or increase, practices My laws and walks in My statutes—he will not die for the iniquity of his father, he will surely live.
18:18 “As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, committed robbery from his brother and did what is not good among his people—behold, he will die for his iniquity.
18:19 Yet you say, ‘Why does the son not bear the iniquity of the father with him?’ When the son has done what is lawful and right, has kept all My statutes and has done them, he will surely live.
18:20 The soul that sins, he will die. The son will not bear the iniquity of the father with him, nor will the father bear the iniquity of the son with him. The righteousness of the righteous will be on him and the wickedness of the wicked will be on him.
18:21 But if the wicked turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all My laws and does what is lawful and right, he will surely live, he will not die.
18:22 None of his transgressions that he committed will be remembered; because of his righteousness that he practiced, he will live.
18:23 “Do I delight at all in the death of the wicked?” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:24 But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity and does according to all the detestable acts that the wicked man does, will he live?

19:1 “As for you, raise a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
19:2 and say: ‘What was your mother? A lioness! Among lions she couched, among young lions she reared her cubs.
19:3 When she raised up one of her cubs, he became a young lion. When he learned to tear prey, he devoured people.
19:4 When the nations heard about him, he was caught in their pit. They brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
19:5 When she saw that she waited in vain, her hope was lost. So she took another cub and made him a young lion.
19:6 He prowled among the lions. He became a young lion, learned to catch prey, devoured men.
19:7 He ravaged their widows and laid waste their cities. The land and all who were in it were terrified from his roaring.
19:8 The nations gathered against him on every side from the provinces. They spread their net over him. He was caught in their pit.
19:9 They put him in a cage with hooks and brought him to the king of Babylon. They brought him in hunting nets. So his roar was no longer heard on the mountains of Israel.
19:10 “Your mother was like a vine in your blood, planted by the water. It was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water.
19:11 Its strong rods became rulers’ scepters. Its height was exalted above the clouds. It was seen in its height with the mass of its branches.
19:12 But it was uprooted in fury. It was cast down to the ground. The east wind dried up its fruit. Its strong branches were broken off and dried up—fire consumed it.
19:13 Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
19:14 Fire has spread from its main branch and devoured its fruit. No strong branch is left on it to become a ruler’s scepter.” This is a lamentation, and it is to be used as a lamentation.
20:1 On the tenth day of the fifth month of the seventh year, some of the elders of Israel came to seek </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:2 The word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

20:6 On that day I lifted up My hand to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had sought out for them, flowing with milk and honey, the splendor of all lands.
20:7 I said to them, ‘Each of you must throw away every detestable thing from his eyes, and not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
20:8 “But they rebelled against Me and were unwilling to listen to Me. None of them cast away the detestable things that were before their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. So I resolved to pour out My fury upon them, to expend My anger upon them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
20:9 But I acted, for the sake of My Name, to keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations, where they were, in whose sight I made Myself known to them, to bring them out from the land of Egypt.
20:10 So I led them out from the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
20:11 I gave them My laws and taught them My judgments, which if a man does, he will live by them.
20:12 I also gave them My </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Shabbatot

20:14 But for the sake of My Name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
20:15 Yet I also lifted My hand to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the splendor of all lands.
20:16 For they rejected My laws, did not walk in My rulings and profaned My </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Shabbatot
20:17 Nevertheless, My eye spared them from destruction, so I did not make a full end of them in the wilderness.
20:18 “I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, do not keep their ordinances, do not defile yourselves with their idols.

20:22 Nevertheless, I withheld My hand. For the sake of My Name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
20:23 I also lifted up My hand to them in the wilderness, to scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries.
20:24 For they had not obeyed My ordinances, but had rejected My statutes and profaned My </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Shabbatot
20:25 I also gave them statutes that were not good, ordinances by which they could not live.
20:26 I let them become polluted in their own gifts, when they offered up all that opened the womb to pass through the fire, so that I might make them desolate, so that they would know that I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

20:29 So I asked them, ‘What is the high place where you are going?’ So the name of it is called Bamah to this day.

21:26 For the king of Babylon stands at the fork in the road, at the start of the two roads, to seek divination. He shakes the arrows, consults the idols, he looks in the liver.
21:27 In his right hand is the lot for Jerusalem—to set up battering rams, to open the mouth for slaughter, to lift up the voice with a war cry, to set up battering rams against the gates, to cast up ramps, to build a siege wall.
21:28 It will seem to them like a false divination. They have sworn solemn oaths, but he will remember their iniquity, so they may be seized.”

23:3 They were harlots in Egypt; they were harlots in their youth; their bosoms were caressed there and their virgin breasts were fondled.
23:4 Their names were Oholah, the older one, and Oholibah, her sister. They became Mine, and they gave birth to sons and daughters. As for their names, Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
23:5 “Oholah prostituted herself, though she was Mine. She lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians, warriors,
23:6 dressed in blue, governors and rulers, all of them handsome young men, horsemen riding on horses.
23:7 She prostituted herself with them, all of the choice men of Assyria. She defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after.
23:8 She did not give up her harlotry in Egypt; for in her youth they had lain with her. They fondled her virgin breasts and poured out their lust on her.
23:9 Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, whom she lusted after.
23:10 They stripped her naked, they took her sons and her daughters and slaughtered her with the sword. She became notorious among women. Judgments were executed upon her.
23:11 “Now her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more depraved in her lust than her sister and her promiscuous acts worse.
23:12 She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and rulers, warriors splendidly clad, horsemen riding on horses, all of them handsome young men.
23:13 I saw that she defiled herself; they both went the same way.
23:14 But she kept increasing her harlotry. She saw men carved on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans carved in red,
23:15 girded with sashes on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them had the appearance of officers, the likeness of Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their birth.
23:16 As soon as she saw them she lusted after them. She sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
23:17 The Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and defiled her with their lust. Yet when she was defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust.
23:18 When she exposed her harlotry and uncovered her nakedness, My soul was disgusted by her, just as My soul was disgusted by her sister.
23:19 Yet she multiplied her harlotry—remembering the days of her youth, when she was a harlot in the land of Egypt.
23:20 She lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like that of horses.
23:21 So you revisited the promiscuity of your youth, when the Egyptians used to fondle your bosom and youthful breasts.
23:22 “Therefore Oholibah, thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:23 the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa and Koa and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, governors and rulers all of them, commanders and officers, all of them riding on horses.
23:24 They will come against you with armed chariots, whirling wheels and an assembly of people. They will set themselves against you on every side with armor, shield and helmet. I will delegate judgment to them, so they will judge you according to their standards of justice.
23:25 I will vent My jealousy against you, letting them deal with you in fury. They will cut off your nose and your ears, and your survivors will fall by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters, and your survivors will be devoured by fire.
23:26 They will strip your clothes and take your beautiful jewelry.
23:27 I will put an end to you and your immorality brought from the land of Egypt. You will no longer lift your eyes toward them or remember Egypt anymore.”
23:28 For thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:29 They will treat you with hatred, take all your property and leave you naked and exposed. The vulgarity of your prostitutions will be uncovered—your debauchery and your promiscuity.
23:30 These things will be done to you, for you have gone as a harlot after the nations, so you are defiled with their idols.
23:31 You have walked in the way of your sister, so I will give her cup into your hand.”
23:32 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:33 You will be filled with drunkenness and agony, a cup of horror and desolation—the cup of your sister Samaria.
23:34 You will drink it and drain it, gnaw its shards and tear your breasts. For I have spoken.” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:35 Therefore thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:36 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:37 For they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols and even offered their children, whom they bore for Me, to be devoured.
23:38 Again, this they have done to Me—they defiled My Sanctuary on the same day and profaned My </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Shabbatot
23:39 On the same day that they slaughtered their children to their idols, they came into My Sanctuary to profane it. See, that is what they have done within My House!
23:40 “Furthermore, they sent for men who come from far away. A messenger was sent to them, and look, they came! For them you bathed, painted your eyes and decked yourself with jewelry.
23:41 You sat on a glorious bed, with a table arranged before it, on which you set out My incense and My oil.
23:42 The sound of a carefree crowd was with her. Many of the men who came from the desert were drunkards. They put bracelets on their hands and beautiful crowns on their heads.”
23:43 Then I said about her, worn out from harlotry: “Still they commit immorality with her—even her?
23:44 They keep going to her, as they go to a prostitute. So they went to Oholah and to Oholibah—the obscene women.
23:45 Righteous men would judge them as adulteresses are judged and as those who shed blood are judged. For they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands.”
23:46 For thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:47 The assembly will stone them to death and dispatch them with their swords. They will slaughter their sons and daughters. They will burn down their houses.
23:48 So I will make obscenity cease from the land, that all women may be taught not to imitate your obscenity.
23:49 They will repay you both for wickedness and you will bear the sins of your idols. So you will know that I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

24:6 Therefore thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:7 For her bloodshed is in her midst. She put it on the bare rock; she did not pour it upon the ground to cover it with dust.

24:9 Therefore thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

24:11 I will set it empty upon the coals until it gets hot and its copper scorches, so its impurity will be melted, its corrosion consumed.
24:12 It has wearied toil, yet its thick rust will not come out of it. Into the fire with its corrosion!
24:13 Because of your filthy obscenity, though I tried to purify you yet you were not made pure, you will never be cleansed from your filth until I have satisfied My fury on you.
24:14 I, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:15 The word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:16 “Son of man, behold, I am about to take away the desire of your eyes with a single blow. But do not lament, do not weep or allow any tears to flow.
24:17 Sigh silently, do not observe mourning for the dead, keep your turban fastened, and keep your sandals on your feet. Do not cover your upper lip or eat the bread of mourners.”
24:18 So I spoke to the people in the morning and my wife died in the evening. In the morning I did just as I was commanded.
24:19 The people said to me, “Won’t you tell us what these things you are doing mean to us?”
24:20 Then I said to them, “The word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

24:22 You will do just as I have done: you will not cover your upper lips or eat the bread of mourners.
24:23 Your turbans will remain on your heads and your shoes on your feet—you will not lament or weep. But you will pine away in your iniquities and groan to each other.
24:24 Ezekiel will be a sign for you; just as he has done, you will do. When this comes, you will know that I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:25 “You, son of man, on the day when I take from them their stronghold, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, the longing of their soul, as well as their sons and their daughters—
24:26 on that day a fugitive will come to you to tell you the news.
24:27 On that day your mouth will be opened to him who escaped. You will speak and no longer be mute. So you will be a sign for them, and they will know that I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

26:4 They will destroy the walls of Tyre and tear down her towers. I will sweep her dust from her and make her a bare rock.

26:10 You will be covered with dust from the multitude of his horses. At the noise of the horsemen, wheels and chariots, your walls will shake, when he enters your gates, as men enter a breached city.
26:11 With the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets. He will kill your people with the sword. The pillars of your strength will come down to the ground.
26:12 They will rob your riches and plunder your merchandise. They will tear down your walls and destroy your fine houses. They will cast your stones and your lumber and your dust into the midst of the sea.
26:13 I will put an end to the sound of your songs. The sound of your lyres will no longer be heard.

26:17 They will lift a lament for you and say to you: ‘How you have perished —you who were inhabited from the seas, the renowned city, strong in the sea, you and your inhabitants, who spread their terror for all your inhabitants!

27:4 Your borders are in the heart of the seas, your builders perfected your beauty.
27:5 All your planks have been fashioned from cypress trees of Senir. They took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
27:6 They made your oars from Bashan’s oaks. Of boxwood from the islands of Kittim they made your decks, inlaid with ivory.
27:7 Fine Egyptian linen was your sail, serving as a banner for you. Your awning was blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah.
27:8 The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers. Your skilled men, Tyre, were on you —they were your sailors.
27:9 The elders of Gebal and her experts were within you, caulking your leaks. All the ships of the sea with their sailors were with you to trade for your wares.
27:10 Persia, Lud and Put were in your army, our men of war. They hung the shield and helmet in you; they gave you splendor.
27:11 Men of Arvad and Helech were all around on your walls, the Gammadim were in your towers. They hung their shields all around on your walls. They perfected your beauty.
27:12 “‘Tarshish was your trading partner because of the abundance of all riches. With silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded for your merchandise.
27:13 Javan, Tubal and Meshech were your traffickers—they gave lives of people and vessels of bronze for your wares.
27:14 Those from the house of Togarmah traded for your merchandise with horses, steeds and mules.
27:15 The men of Dedan traded with you; many coastlands were your customers; they brought you horns of ivory and ebony as your payment.
27:16 Aram was your customer because of your abundant goods—they traded for your merchandise with emerald, purple and embroidered cloth, fine linen, coral and rubies.
27:17 Judah and the land of Israel were your customers; they traded for your wares with wheat of Minnith, confections, honey, oil and balm.
27:18 Damascus was your customer because of the abundance of your goods and all your great wealth, with the wine of Helbon and wool of white.
27:19 Vedan and Javan from Uzal traded for your wares—ironwork, cinnamon and spices were bartered for your merchandise.
27:20 Dedan was your dealer in saddlecloth for riding.
27:21 Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were your favored trading partners in lambs, rams and goats; in these they were your customers.
27:22 The merchants of Sheba and Raamah were your vendors—they traded for your wares with the finest spices, all precious stones and gold.
27:23 Haran and Canneh and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur and Chilmad traded with you.
27:24 They traded for your merchandise with gorgeous fabrics, garments of blue and richly woven work, carpets of multi-colored material, with cords twisted and tightly knotted.
27:25 The ships of Tarshish serve as carriers for your wares. “‘So you were filled and heavily loaded in the heart of the seas.
27:26 Your rowers have brought you into great waters. But the east wind will break you in the heart of the seas.
27:27 Your riches, your wares, your merchan­dise, your sailors, your pilots, your caulkers, the traders of your merchandise, all your men of war that are in you, with all your company in your midst will fall into the heart of the seas on the day of your downfall.
27:28 At the sound of the cry of your pilots the countryside will shake.
27:29 All the oarsmen, the sailors and all the mariners of the sea will come down from their ships to stand on the ground.
27:30 They will raise their voices over you and cry bitterly. They will throw up dust on their heads. They will roll themselves in ashes.
27:31 They will shave themselves bald for you and put on sackcloth. They will weep for you with bitter soul, with bitter lament.
27:32 In their wailing they will take up a lament for you. They will mourn over you: “Who was like Tyre—silenced in the midst of the sea?”
27:33 When your merchandise came out from the seas, you satisfied many people. With the abundance of your wealth and your wares you enriched the kings of the earth.
27:34 Now you are shattered by the seas in the depths of the waters. Your merchandise and all your company have fallen in your midst.
27:35 All the inhabitants of the coastlands are appalled at you. Their kings are horribly afraid, their faces are convulsed.
27:36 The merchants among the people hiss at you. You have become a horror and will be no more.’”

28:9 Will you still say, ‘I am a god’ before the one who slays you? Yet you are man, and not a god, in the hand of those who pierce you.
28:10 You will die the deaths of the uncircumcised at the hand of strangers. For I have spoken.” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

28:13 You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was your covering —ruby, topaz and diamond, beryl, onyx and jasper, sapphire, turquoise and emerald—your settings and your sockets a workmanship of gold —in the day you were created they were prepared.
28:14 You were an anointed guardian cheruv. I placed you on the holy mountain of God. You walked among stones of fire.
28:15 You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, until unrighteousness was found in you.
28:16 By the abundance of your trade they filled you within with violence. So you have sinned. So I threw you out as a profane thing from the mountain of God. I made you vanish, guardian cheruv, from among the stones of fire.
28:17 Your heart was exalted because of your beauty. You corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. I threw you down to the earth. Before kings I set you up as a spectacle.
28:18 “‘By the multitude of your iniquities, in the injustice of your trade, you profaned your sanctuaries. So I brought fire out from within you, and it has consumed you. I have turned you to ashes on the earth in the eyes of all who saw you.

29:11 No human foot will pass through it, and no foot of beast will pass through it. It will be uninhabited for 40 years.
29:12 I will make the land of Egypt a desolation among devastated countries. Her cities will be a desolation 40 years among ruined cities. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries.”

30:16 I will set a fire in Egypt. Sin will writhe in anguish. No will be assaulted. Noph will face enemies daily.
30:17 The young men of Aven and Pi-beseth will fall by the sword and the women will go into captivity.
30:18 In Tehaphnehes the day will grow dark when I break the yokes of Egypt there. The pride of her power will cease in her —a cloud will cover her. Her daughters will go into captivity.

31:3 Behold, Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful branches shadowing the forest, of lofty height. Its top was in leafy branches.
31:4 Water nourished it, the deep made it tall, with its rivers going around its planting as it sent out its water-courses to all the trees of the field.
31:5 Therefore its height was loftier than all the trees of the field. Its branches multiplied and its boughs became long because of the abundant water in its shoots.
31:6 All the birds of the sky nested in its branches. All the beasts of the field gave birth to their young under its branches. All great nations lived under its shade.
31:7 It was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches, for its root was in abundant water.
31:8 The cedars in the garden of God could not compare with it. No cypress trees could rival its boughs. No plane-trees could match its branches. No tree in the garden of God could compare to its beauty.
31:9 I made it beautiful with its many limbs. All the trees of Eden in God’s garden envied it.’”
31:10 Therefore thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
31:11 I gave it into the hand of a ruler of nations, who surely dealt with it. I drove it out as befits its wickedness.
31:12 Ruthless barbarians from the nations cut it down. They cast it down on the mountains and in all the valleys its branches fell. Its branches have laid broken in all the streambeds of the land. All the people of the earth have come out from its shade and abandoned it.
31:13 All the birds of the sky lived on its fallen trunk and all the beasts of the field upon its fallen branches.
31:14 So none of all the trees by the water should exalt themselves in their height or set their top among the leafy boughs. None of their well-watered mighty ones should attain their height. For they have all been given to death, to the lowest regions under the earth, among the children of men who go down to the Pit.”
31:15 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

32:6 I will drench the land with the flow of your blood up to the hills. The ravines will be full of you.
32:7 When I extinguish you, I will cover the sky and darken the stars. I will cover the sun with cloud, and the moon will not give her light.

32:24 “There is Elam and all her multitude surrounding her grave —all of them slain, fallen by the sword —who went down uncircumcised into the underworld, who caused terror in the land of the living. They bear their disgrace with those who go down to the Pit.
32:25 They have made her a bed among the slain with all her throng, her graves about them —all of them uncircumcised, slain, fallen by the sword— though they caused terror in the land of the living. So they bear their disgrace with those who go down to the Pit. They are laid among the slain.
32:26 “Meshech-Tubal is there and all her throng, her graves around them —all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they spread their terror in the land of the living.

33:9 If you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it and he does not turn from his way, then he will die in his iniquity—but you have saved your soul.
33:10 “You, son of man, say to the house of Israel: ‘You have said, “Surely our transgressions and our sins are upon us and we are pining away in them. So how can we live.”
33:11 Say to them: ‘As I live’—it is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:12 “You, son of man, say to the children of your people: ‘The righteousness of the righteous person will not deliver him in the day of his transgression.

33:13  When I tell the righteous that he will surely live, but he trusts in his own righteousness and commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered. But in his iniquity that he has committed, he will die.
33:14 When I say to the wicked, “You will surely die,” yet he turns from his sin and does what is just and right—

33:24 “Son of man, the inhabitants of these ruins in the land of Israel keep saying, ‘Abraham was only one, yet he inherited the land. Since we are many, the land is given to us as a possession.’
33:25 “Therefore say to them, thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:26 You rely on your sword, commit abominations and each of you defiles his neighbor’s wife. Should you possess the land?’
33:27 Say this to them, thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
33:28 I will make the land a desolation and a horror. The pride of her power will cease. The mountains of Israel will be desolate, so that no one will pass through.’

33:31 So they come to you, as people come, and sit before you as My people and hear your words—but they do not do them—for with their mouth they express doting love, but their heart goes after their own dishonest gain.
33:32 Look, you are like a love song to them, one who has a beautiful voice and can play well on an instrument. They hear your words, but do not practice them.
33:33 When this comes to pass—behold, it is coming—they will know that a prophet has been among them.”
34:1 The word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:2 “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say to those shepherds, thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:3 You eat the fat. You clothe yourself with the wool. You kill the fat ones. But you do not take care of the sheep.
34:4 You do not strengthen the weak, heal the sick, bind up the broken, bring back the stray or seek the lost. Instead, you have ruled over them with force and cruelty.
34:5 They were scattered for lack of a shepherd. They became food for all the beasts of the field as they were scattered.
34:6 My sheep wandered through all the mountains and on every high hill. Over all the face of the earth My sheep were scattered. No one searched. No one sought.”
34:7 Therefore, shepherds, hear the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:8 “As I live”—it is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

34:10 thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:11 For thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:12 As a shepherd seeks out his sheep on the day he is among his scattered flock, so I will seek out My sheep. I will rescue them out of all the places where they have been scattered, on a day of cloud and thick darkness.
34:13 I will bring them out from the peoples. I will gather them from the countries. I will bring them back to their own land. I will shepherd them upon the mountains of Israel, by the streams and in all the habitable places of the land.
34:14 I will shepherd them in a good pasture—their grazing place will be on the high mountains of Israel. There they will lie down on good grazing ground. They will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.
34:15 I will tend My flock and make them lie down”—it is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:16 “I will seek the lost, bring back the stray, bind up the broken and strengthen the sick. But the fat and the strong I will destroy—I will tend them with justice.
34:17 As for you, My flock”—thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:18 Was it too little for you that you were feeding in the good pasture? Must you trample down the rest of your pastures with your feet? You were drinking clear water. Must you muddy the rest with your feet?
34:19 Yet My sheep must eat what you have trampled with your feet and drink what you have muddied with your feet!”
34:20 Therefore thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
34:21 Because you thrust with your side and with shoulder and gore all the weak with your horns, until you have scattered them all over,
34:22 I will save My flock. They will no longer be prey. I will judge between sheep and sheep.
34:23 So I will set up One Shepherd over them, My servant David—He will tend them, He will feed them Himself and be their shepherd.
34:24 I, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

34:28 They will no longer be prey to the nations. The beast of the earth will not devour them. They will live in security. No one will make them afraid.
34:29 I will make their agriculture renowned. They will no longer be consumed with hunger in the land. They will no longer bear the scorn of the nations.
34:30 They will know that I, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

35:8 I will fill its mountains with its slain; on your hills, your valleys and all your streams those slain by the sword will fall.
35:9 I will make you everlasting desolations; your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

35:14 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
35:15 As you rejoiced over inheriting the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will do to you. You will be desolate, Mount Seir and all Edom—all of it. Then they will know that I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

36:10 I will settle a large population upon you—the whole house of Israel, all of it. The cities will be inhabited. The desolate places will be built up.

36:19 I scattered them among the nations, so they were dispersed through the countries. According to their way and their deeds I judged them.
36:20 Wherever they went among the nations, they profaned My holy Name, since it was said about them, ‘These are the people of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

39:10 They will not take wood out of the field or cut anything from the forests, for they will make fire from the weapons. They will plunder those who plundered them and loot those who looted them.” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
39:11 “On that day, I will give Gog a burial place there in Israel, the valley of the travelers east of the sea. It will block those who travel through, since they will bury Gog and all his multitude there. Then they will call it the valley of Hamon-Gog.
39:12 The house of Israel will bury them for seven months, in order to cleanse the land.
39:13 All the people of the land will bury them. It will be memorable for them, a day when I am glorified.” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
39:14 “Men will be continually set apart to travel through the land and bury the travelers remaining on the face of the land, in order to cleanse it. At the end of seven months, they will make their search.
39:15 When they travel through the land, if any sees a man’s bone, he will set up a sign by it, until the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.
39:16 Hamonah will also be the name of the city. So they will cleanse the land.
39:17 “You, son of man”—thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
39:18 You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the princes of the earth—as rams, lambs, goats, bulls—all of them fatlings of Bashan.
39:19 So you will eat fat until you are gorged and you will drink blood until you are drunk, from My sacrificial feast that I have prepared for you.
39:20 You will be filled at My table with horses and horsemen, with mighty men and all the warriors.’” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

39:23 The nations will know that the house of Israel went into exile for their iniquity, because they broke faith with Me. So I hid My face from them and gave them into the hand of their enemies. All of them fell by the sword.
39:24 I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their transgressions. I hid My face from them.”
39:25 Therefore thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
39:26 They will bear their shame and all their disloyalty by which they broke faith with Me, when they were living securely in their land, with no one making them afraid.
39:27 When I have brought them back from the peoples and have gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, I will be sanctified in them in the eyes of many nations.
39:28 Then they will know that I am </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

40:1 In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month—in the fourteenth year after the city was struck down, on that very day—the hand of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
40:2 In visions God brought me to the land of Israel and set me down upon a very high mountain. On it, toward the south, was something like the construction of a city.
40:3 He brought me there, and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like bronze. He had a linen cord in his hand and a measuring rod. He was standing in the gateway.
40:4 The man said to me, “Son of man, see with your eyes, hear with your ears, set your heart on all that I show you—for I brought you here in order to show you—and report all that you see to the house of Israel.”
40:5 Behold, an outer wall was all around the House. The measuring rod in the man’s hand was six cubits long, each of which was a normal cubit and a handbreadth. When he measured the thickness of the wall structure, it was one rod, and the height was one rod.
40:6 Then he went to the gate that faced east and went up its steps. When he measured the threshold of the gate, it was one rod wide. Also the other threshold was one rod wide.
40:7 Each guard chamber was one rod long and one rod wide. The space between the chambers was five cubits. The threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate, facing the House, measured one rod.
40:8 When he measured the porch of the gate toward the House, it was one rod.
40:9 When he measured the porch of the gate, it was eight cubits; its pillars were two cubits. The porch of the gate faced the House.
40:10 Now the guard chambers of the east gate were three on this side, and three on the other side—the three had the same measurement. The side pillars had the same measure on this side and on that side.
40:11 When he measured the width of the entrance of the gate, it was ten cubits, and the length of the gate was 13 cubits.
40:12 A barrier wall was in front of the guard chambers, one cubit on each side. Each chamber was six cubits on each side.
40:13 When he measured the gate from the roof of the one chamber to the roof of the other, the width was 25 cubits, door facing door.
40:14 Then he did the pillars—60 cubits. A gateway extended all around to the pillar of the courtyard.
40:15 Now from the front of the gate of the entrance to the front of the inner porch of the gate measured 50 cubits.
40:16 There were shuttered windows toward the chambers and toward their pillars within the surrounding gate, and likewise the porches had windows all around inside. On each pillar were palm trees.
40:17 Then he brought me to the outer court. Behold, there were rooms and pavement, made for the surrounding court, with 30 rooms along the pavement.
40:18 The pavement was by the side of the gates, as wide as the gates were long. This was the lower pavement.
40:19 He measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the exterior front of the inner court—it was 100 cubits, to the east and to the north.
40:20 Next he measured the length and width of the gate of the outer court facing toward the north.
40:21 Its guard chambers were three on this side and three on that side. Its pillars and its porches had the same measurements as the first gate—50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide.
40:22 Its windows, porches and palm trees were the same measurements as the gate facing toward the east. Its stairway had seven steps, and its porch was in front of them.
40:23 A gate to the inner court was opposite the other gate, northward and eastward. He measured 100 cubits from gate to gate.
40:24 Then he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate toward the south. He measured its pillars and its porches. They had the same measurements.
40:25 The gate and its porch had windows all around, like the other windows, 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide.
40:26 Its stairway had seven steps, and its porches were in front of them. It had palm-trees on its pillars, one on this side and another on that side.
40:27 There was a gate to the inner court toward the south. He measured from gate to gate toward the south—100 cubits.
40:28 Then he brought me to the inner court through the south gate. When he measured the south gate, it had the same measurements.
40:29 Its chambers, pillars and porch had the same measurements. There were windows in it and in the surrounding porch. It was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide.
40:30 There were porches all around, 25 cubits long and five cubits wide.
40:31 Its porch was toward the outer court. Palm-trees were on its pillars. Its stairway had eight steps.
40:32 Then he brought me into the inner court toward the east. He measured it with the same measurements.
40:33 Its chambers, pillars and porch had the same measurements. There were windows in it and in its surrounding porch. It was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide.
40:34 Its porch was toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its pillars on this side and on that side. Its stairway had eight steps.
40:35 He brought me to the north gate. He measured it with the same measurements:
40:36 its chambers, pillars and porch. There were windows in it all around. It was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide.
40:37 Its pillars were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its pillars, on this side and on that side. Its stairway had eight steps.
40:38 A chamber with its entry was by the pillars at the gates; there they rinse the burnt offering.
40:39 In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, on which to slaughter the burnt offering, the sin offering and the guilt offering.
40:40 Off to the side, on the outside as one goes up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables. On the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables.
40:41 Four tables were on one side and four tables were on the other side, by the side of the gate—eight tables, on which they would slaughter.
40:42 There were four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit high. The instruments for the slaughter of the burnt offering and the sacrifice were laid on them.
40:43 Hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened in the House all around. The flesh of the offering was to be placed upon the tables.
40:44 Outside the inner gate in the inner court were chambers for the singers, one of which was at the side of the north gate, facing south. The one at the side of the east gate faced north.
40:45 He said to me, “This chamber that faces toward the south is for the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
40:46 The chamber that faces toward the north is for the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
40:47 Then he measured the court. It was 100 cubits long and 100 cubits wide, a square. The altar was in front of the House.
40:48 He brought me to the porch of the House. He measured each pillar of the porch, five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side. The width of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side.
40:49 The length of the porch was 20 cubits and the width 11 cubits. It was ascended by way of steps, where pillars stood, one on each side.
41:1 Then he brought me to the Temple, and measured the pillars—six cubits wide on one side, six cubits wide on the other side, which was the width of the tent.
41:2 The width of the entrance was ten cubits. The sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side and five cubits on the other side. He measured its length, 40 cubits and its width, 20 cubits.
41:3 He went to the inner room and measured each pillar of the entrance, two cubits; the doorway, six cubits; and the width of the doorway, seven cubits.
41:4 When he measured the inner room’s length, it was 20 cubits, and the width was 20 cubits, in front of the Temple. He said to me, “This is the Holy of Holies.”
41:5 When he measured the wall of the House, it was six cubits, and the width of every side chamber was four cubits, surrounding the House on every side.
41:6 There were 33 side chambers. There were supports in the wall, which belonged to the House for the side chambers all around, so that they were not supported by the wall of the House.
41:7 The side chambers were wider as they wound about higher and higher. Because the winding about of the House went higher and higher round about the house, therefore the width of the House expanded. One went up from the lowest row to the highest by way of the middle.
41:8 I saw also that the House had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers were a full rod of six cubits up to the joint.
41:9 The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits. The space between the side chambers of the House
41:10 and the outer chambers was 20 cubits wide all around the House on every side.
41:11 The doors of the side chambers were toward the space, one door toward the north and another door toward the south. The width of the space was five cubits all around.
41:12 The building that was before the separate area at the side toward the west was 70 cubits wide. The wall of the building was five cubits thick all around and its length was 90 cubits.
41:13 When he measured the House, it was 100 cubits long; the separate area and the building with its walls, was 100 cubits long;
41:14 and the width of the face of the House and the separate area toward the east was also 100 cubits.
41:15 When he measured the length of the building facing the separate area behind it, with its galleries on each side, it was 100 cubits. Now the inner Sanctuary and the porches of the court—
41:16 the thresholds, the shuttered windows, and the galleries all around in three stories opposite the thresholds—were paneled with wood all around, from the ground up to the windows (even the windows were covered),
41:17 over the space above the door, as far as the inner House, and on all the wall outside all around inside and outside, by measurement.
41:18 It was made with </span><span class="it"><span class="content">cheruvim
41:19 the face of a man toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. Thus was it made on all the House all around.
41:20 The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">cheruvim
41:21 The Temple’s doorposts were square. Now the front of the Sanctuary had something resembling
41:22 an altar—three cubits high and two cubits long, made of wood. Its corners, its base and its sides were also of wood. He said to me, “This is the table of the Presence of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
41:23 The Temple and the inner Sanctuary each had double doors.
41:24 The doors each had two turning leaves—two leaves for one door and two leaves for the other.
41:25 Cheruvim and palm trees were made on them, on the doors of the Temple, just like those made on the walls. There were thick beams of wood on the face of the porch outside.
41:26 There were shuttered windows and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the porch, the side chambers of the House and the thick beams.
42:1 He led me out to the outer courtyard toward the north. He brought me to the chamber that was opposite the separate area and opposite the building toward the north.
42:2 The length of the building with the door on the north was 100 cubits and the width was 50 cubits.
42:3 Opposite the 20 cubit space belonging to the inner court and opposite the pavement belonging to the outer court was gallery by gallery in three stories.
42:4 In front of the chambers was a walkway ten cubits wide and 100 cubits long. Their doorways were toward the north.
42:5 The upper chambers were narrower, because the galleries took more away from them than from the lower and the middle ones in the building.
42:6 For they were in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courtyards; therefore more space was taken away than from the lower and the middle floors, in comparison with the ground.
42:7 A wall that was outside by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court in front of the chambers, was 50 cubits in length.
42:8 For the chambers that were toward the outer court were 50 cubits long while those facing the Temple were 100 cubits.
42:9 Below these chambers was the entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer courtyard.
42:10 In the thickness of the wall of the courtyard toward the east, in front of the separate area and in front of the building, there were chambers.
42:11 The passageway in front of them were similar to the chambers on the north, as long and wide as them, with all their exits and similar arrangements and doors.
42:12 Corresponding to the doorways of the chambers on the south, there was a doorway at the head of the passageway—a way directly in front of the wall toward the east, as one enters them.
42:13 Then he said to me, “The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate area, they are the holy chambers, where the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
42:14 Once the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
42:15 When he had finished measuring the inner House, he brought me out by way of the gate facing east and measured all around.
42:16 When he measured the east side with the measuring rod, it was 500 rods, with the measuring rod round about.
42:17 When he measured the north side, it was 500 rods by the measuring rod.
42:18 When he measured the south side, it was 500 rods, with the measuring rod.
42:19 Then he turned about to the west side and measured 500 rods with the measuring rod.
42:20 So he measured the four sides. It had a wall all around—the length was 500 and the width was 500—to make a distinction between the holy and the profane.
43:1 Then he led me to the gate, the gate looking east,
43:2 and behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters. The earth was radiant with His glory.
43:3 The appearance of the vision that I saw was like the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city. The visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar. So I fell on my face.
43:4 Then the glory of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
43:5 The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Ruach
43:6 Then I heard someone speaking to me from the House, while a man was standing beside me.
43:7 He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of My throne, the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
43:8 Whenever they set their threshold next to My threshold and their doorpost next to My doorpost, with only a wall between Me and them, they defiled My holy Name by their abominations that they committed. So I have finished them off in My fury.
43:9 Now let them put away their prostitution and the corpses of their kings, far from Me. Then I will dwell among them forever.
43:10 “You, son of man, describe the House to the house of Israel, so they will be ashamed of their iniquities. Let them measure accurately.
43:11 If they are ashamed of all they have done, sketch out the House for them, its layout, its exits and its entrances, its complete design, with all its ordinances and all its laws. Write it down in their sight, so they may observe its complete design and all its ordinances and do them.
43:12 This is the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Torah
43:13 “These are the measurements of the altar by cubits (a cubit being a normal cubit plus a handbreadth). Its gutter will be a cubit deep and a cubit wide. Its rim will be one span surrounding the edge. This will be the base of the altar.
43:14 From the base on the ground to the lower ledge will be two cubits and the width one cubit. From the smaller ledge to the larger ledge will be four cubits and the width a cubit.
43:15 The altar hearth will be four cubits high. Four horns will project upward from the hearth.
43:16 The hearth will be 12 cubits long by 12 wide, with four sides square.
43:17 The ledge will be 14 cubits long and 14 wide with four sides square. The border surrounding it will be half a cubit and its bottom will be a cubit all around. Its steps will face east.”
43:18 Then he said to me, “Son of man, thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
43:19 Give a young bull for a sin offering to the Levitical </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
43:20 “You are to take some of its blood and put it on its four horns, on the four corners of the ledge and on the border around it. So you will purify it and make atonement for it.
43:21 Take the bull of the sin offering and burn it in the appointed place of the House, outside the Sanctuary.
43:22 “On the second day, offer a male goat without blemish as a sin offering. They will purify the altar as they purified it with the bull.
43:23 When you have finished purifying it, offer a young bull without blemish and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
43:24 Present them before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
43:25 Every day for seven days, prepare a goat as a sin offering. They will prepare a young bull and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.

43:27 When they have completed the days, from the eighth day and onward the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
44:1 Then he brought me back to the outer gate of the Sanctuary looking east. It was shut.
44:2  God of Israel has entered through it. So it is to be kept shut.
44:3 Only the prince, since he is a prince, will sit there to eat bread before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
44:4 Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the House. I looked, and behold, the glory of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
44:5 ’s House and all its laws. Set your heart to the entrance of the House, with all exits of the Sanctuary.
44:6 Say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
44:7 You brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My Sanctuary, to profane it—My House—when you offer My bread, the fat and the blood. They have broken My covenant, to add to all your abominations.
44:8 You have not kept charge of My holy things, but you have set keepers of My service in My Sanctuary to please yourselves.’”
44:9 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
44:10 For the Levites who went far from Me, when Israel went astray after their idols, will bear their iniquity.
44:11 Yet they will be ministers in My Sanctuary, overseers of the gates of the House and ministering in the House. They will slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people. They will stand before them to minister to them.
44:12 Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have lifted up My hand against them”—it is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
44:13 They will not come near to Me, to minister to Me as </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
44:14 “Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of the House, for all its service and for all that will be done in it.
44:15 So the Levitical </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
44:16 “They are ones who will enter My Sanctuary and draw near to My table to minister to Me. They will keep My charge.
44:17 It will be that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they will be clothed with linen garments. No wool will come on them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.
44:18 They will have linen turbans upon their heads and linen underclothes upon their loins; they will not wear anything that causes sweat.
44:19 Before they go out to the outer court—to the outer courtyard to the people—they must take off their garments in which they minister and leave them in the holy chambers. They will put on other garments, so they do not consecrate the people while in their garments.
44:20 They must not shave their heads or let their locks grow long, but must carefully trim the hair of their heads.
44:21 No </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
44:22 None may take a widow or a divorced woman as his wife, for they must take virgins of the offspring of the house of Israel or a widow who is the widow of a </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen

44:24 In a lawsuit, they will stand to judge, and judge in accordance with My ordinances. They will keep My laws and My statutes in all My </span><span class="it"><span class="content">moadim
44:25 They must not come near a dead person to defile themselves—only for a father, mother, son, daughter, brother or sister who had no husband may they defile themselves.
44:26 After he is cleansed, they will count seven days for him.
44:27 On the day he goes into the Sanctuary, into the inner court to minister in the Sanctuary, he is to offer his sin offering.” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
44:28 “It will be an inheritance for them. I am their inheritance. Do not give them any possession in Israel for I am their possession.
44:29 They will eat the grain offering, the sin offering and the guilt offering. Every devoted thing in Israel will be theirs.

45:2 Out of this, there will be the Holy Place, 500 long by 500 wide, square all around, and 50 cubits for the open land surrounding it.
45:3 From this area you are to measure a length of 25,000 and a width of 10,000, in which will be the Sanctuary, which is most holy.
45:4 It is to be the holy portion of the land, for the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
45:5 An area 25,000 long by 10,000 wide will be for the Levites, the ministers of the House. It will be a possession for themselves—20 chambers.
45:6 “You will give the city possession of an area 5,000 wide by 25,000 long, alongside the offering of the holy allotment. It will be for the whole house of Israel.
45:7 “The prince will have a portion on either side of the holy allotment and the city’s property, adjacent to the holy offering and the city’s property, on the west side westward and on the east side eastward. Its length will correspond to one of the tribal portions, from the western boundary to the eastern boundary.
45:8 It will be land for him as a possession in Israel. My princes will no longer oppress My people. They will give land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.”
45:9 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
45:10 “You are to have just balances, an honest dry measure and an honest liquid measure.
45:11 The dry and liquid measure will be of a uniform measure: the bath will contain a tenth part of a homer, and the ephah a tenth part of a homer; the standard measure will be the homer.
45:12 The shekel will be 20 gerahs; 20 plus 25 plus 15 shekels will be your mina.
45:13 “This is the offering that you are to set apart: a sixth of an ephah out of a homer of wheat, a sixth of an ephah out of a homer of barley,
45:14 along with the set portion of oil—a bath of oil—as the tithe of the bath for each kor, which is ten baths (or a homer, since ten baths are a homer),
45:15 and one lamb of the flock out of 200, from the well-watered pastures of Israel. These are for the grain offering, burnt offering and fellowship offerings, to make atonement for them.” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

45:25 He will do this in the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, during the Feast, for seven days, for sin offering as well as burnt offering, grain offering as well as oil.”
46:1 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
46:2 The prince will enter by way of the porch of the gate from outside, and stand by the post of the gate. Then the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
46:3 The people of the land will worship at the door of that gate before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
46:4 “The burnt offering that the prince offers to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
46:5 The grain offering will be an ephah for the ram. The grain offering for the lambs will be a gift of his hand and a hin of oil for an ephah.
46:6 On the day of the New Moon it will be a young bull without blemish, six lambs and a ram—they must be without blemish.
46:7 He will prepare a grain offering, an ephah for the bull and an ephah for the ram, for the lambs whatever his hand may reach and a hin of oil for an ephah.
46:8 When the prince enters, he will enter by way of the porch of the gate and he will also exit by that way.
46:9 When the people of the land come before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
46:10 When they enter, the prince will come in among them. When they go out, they will go out together.
46:11 “At the feasts and the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">moadim
46:12 Now if the prince prepares a freewill offering, burnt offering or fellowship offerings as a freewill offering to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
46:13 “You are to prepare a lamb of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
46:14 Also you will prepare a grain offering with it morning by morning, a sixth of an ephah and a third of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour—a grain offering to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
46:15 They will prepare the lamb, the grain offering and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering.”
46:16 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
46:17 But if he gives of his inheritance as a gift to one of his servants, it will be his until the year of liberty, when it will revert to the prince. His inheritance will belong to his sons.
46:18 The prince must not take from the people’s inheritance, evicting them wrongfully out of their property. He must give inheritance to his sons out of his own property, so that My people will not be displaced, anyone from his own property.”
46:19 Then he brought me through the entrance that was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
46:20 He said to me, “This is the place where the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
46:21 Then he brought me out to the outer courtyard and led me past the four corners of the courtyard. Behold, in every corner of the courtyard there was another courtyard.
46:22 In the four corners of the courtyard there were enclosed courts, 40 cubits long by 30 wide—these four in the corners had the same size.
46:23 There was a row of masonry surrounding them, surrounding the four. Boiling places were built under the surrounding rows.
46:24 He said to me, “These are the boiling places where the ministers of the House will boil the sacrifices of the people.”
47:1 Then he brought me back to the door of the House. Behold, water was flowing out from under the threshold of the House eastward—for the front of the House faced east. The water was flowing down from under the right side of the House, south of the altar.
47:2 He brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around outside by the way of the outer gate, the way of the gate looking east. Behold, water was trickling out from the right side.
47:3 When the man went out eastward with a line in his hand, he measured a 1,000 cubits. Then he led me into the water—water to the ankles.
47:4 Again he measured a 1,000, and led me into the water—water to the knees. Again he measured a 1,000, and he led me into the water—water up to the waist.
47:5 Again he measured a 1,000, and now it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen, water to swim in—a river that could not be crossed.
47:6 He said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man?” Then he brought me back to the bank of the river.
47:7 When I had returned, behold, there were very many trees on one side and on the other, along the bank of the river.
47:8 Then he said to me, “These waters go out toward the eastern region. They go down to the Arabah and enter the sea. When they arrive at the sea, the waters of the sea will flow and will become fresh.
47:9 It will be that every living creature that swarms will live wherever the rivers go. There will be a very great multitude of fish, because this water goes there and makes the salt water fresh. So everything will be healed and live wherever the river goes.
47:10 Fishermen will stand by it; from En-gedi to En-eglaim, it will be a place for spreading of nets. Their fish will be of many different kinds—like the fish of the Great Sea, a huge quantity.
47:11 Its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be set aside for salt.
47:12 On the river, on its bank, on this side and that side, will grow every kind of tree for food. Its leaf will not wither; its fruit will not fail; it will bear new fruit every month, because its water flows out from the Sanctuary. Its fruit will be for food and its leaf will be for healing.”
47:13 Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
47:14 You will inherit it, each one like another, as I lifted My hand to give to your fathers. So this land will fall to you as an inheritance.
47:15 “This will be the boundary of the land: on the north side, from the Great Sea, by way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad—
47:16 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath, as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.
47:17 So the border from the sea will be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus, with the territory of Hamath to the north. This will be the northern side.
47:18 The east side, between Hauran, Damascus, Gilead and the land of Israel, will be by the Jordan. You will measure from the northern border to the eastern sea. This will be the eastern side.
47:19 The south side southward will be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the Wadi of Egypt and to the Great Sea. This will be the southern side toward the south.
47:20 The west side will be the Great Sea, from the southern border as far as the front of the entrance of Hamath. This will be the western side.
47:21 You are to divide this land for yourselves to the tribes of Israel.
47:22 So you are to divide it by lot for an inheritance for you and for the outsiders who dwell among you, whoever bears children among you. They will be to you like the native-born of </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
47:23 In whatever tribe the outsider lives, there you will give him his inheritance.” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
48:1 “Now these are the names of the tribes: Dan’s portion will be from the northern frontier, beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar-enan at the northern border of Damascus, beside Hamath, and from eastern side to the sea.
48:2 Next to the territory of Dan, from the east side to the west will be Asher’s one,
48:3 Next to the territory of Asher, from the east side to the west will be Naphtali’s one.
48:4 Next to the territory of Naphtali, from the east side to the west, will be Manasseh’s one.
48:5 Next to the territory of Manasseh, from the east side to the west will be Ephraim’s one.
48:6 Next to the territory of Ephraim, from the east side to the west, will be Reuben’s one.
48:7 Next to the territory of Reuben, from the east side to the west, will be Judah’s one.
48:8 By Judah’s border, from the east side to the west, will be the contribution which you will set aside, 25,000 cubits in width and in length like one of the portions, from the east side to the west. The Sanctuary will be in the midst of it.
48:9 The allotment that you will set apart to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
48:10 The holy allotment will be apportioned for these—for the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
48:11 The sanctified portion will be for the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
48:12 It will be for them a portion set apart from the offering of the land, most holy, by the border of the Levites.
48:13 Alongside the border of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
48:14 They must not sell or exchange any of it or transfer the choice portion of the land, for it is holy to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
48:15 The 5,000 that remain in the width, in front of the 25,000 thousand, will be for common use, for the city, for living and for pastureland. “The city will be in the midst of it,
48:16 and will have these measurements: the north side; 4,500; the south side 4,500; the east side, 4,500; and the west side, 4,500.
48:17 The city will have open land: toward the north 250, toward the south 250, toward the east 250, and toward the west 250.
48:18 The remainder of the length, according to the holy allotment, will be 10,000 eastward and 10,000 westward. It will be alongside the holy allotment. Its produce will be food for those who serve the city.
48:19 Those who serve the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, will till it.
48:20 The whole allotment will be 25,o00 by 25,o00, square; you will set apart the holy allotment with the property of the city.
48:21 “What is remaining from this side and on the other of the holy allotment and the city property will be for the prince. What is adjacent to the 25,000 of the allotment toward the eastern border, and westward adjacent to the 25,000 toward the western border, alongside the portions, will be for the prince. The holy allotment and the Sanctuary of the House will be in the midst of it.
48:22 The property of the Levites and the property of the city will be in the middle of what belongs to the prince; what belongs to the prince will be between Judah’s border and Benjamin’s border.
48:23 As for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west, will be Benjamin’s one.
48:24 Next to the territory of Benjamin, from the east side to the west, will be Simeon’s one.
48:25 Next to the territory of Simeon, from the east side to the west, will be Issachar’s one.
48:26 Next to the territory of Issachar, from the east side to the west, will be Zebulon’s one.
48:27 Next to the territory of Zebulun, from the east side to the west, will be Gad’s one.
48:28 Next to the territory of Gad, at the south side southward, the border will be from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the Wadi, to the Great Sea.
48:29 This is the land that you will divide by lot to the tribes of Israel as an inheritance, and these are their portions.” It is a declaration of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
48:30 “These are the exits of the city: on the north side, 4,500 by measure,
48:31 will be the gates of the city named after of the tribes of Israel—three gates northward—the Reuben Gate, one; the Judah Gate, one; the Levi Gate, one.
48:32 At the east side, 4,500, will be three gates: the Joseph Gate, one; the Benjamin Gate, one; Dan Gate, one.
48:33 At the south side, 4,500 by measure, will be three gates: the Simeon Gate, one; the Issachar Gate, one; the Zebulun Gate, one.
48:34 At the west side, 4,500, with their three gates: the Gad Gate, one; the Asher Gate, one; the Naphtali Gate, one.
48:35 It will be 18,000 cubits all around. “From that day on, the name of the city will be: ‘</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
