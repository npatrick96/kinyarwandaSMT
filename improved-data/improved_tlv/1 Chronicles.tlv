1:44 When Bela died, Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah ruled in his place. 
1:45 When Jobab died, Husham of the land of the Temanites ruled in his place. 
1:46 When Husham died, Hadad the son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, ruled in his place—the name of his city was Avith.

1:52 chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon 
1:53 chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,

2:17 Abigail bore Amasa, and the father of Amasa was Jether the Ishmaelite. 
2:18 Caleb son of Hezron fathered children by Azubah his wife and by Jerioth. These were her sons: Jesher, Shobab and Ardon. 
2:19 When Azubah died, Caleb married Ephrath, who bore him Hur. 
2:20 Hur fathered Uri and Uri fathered Bezalel. 
2:21 Afterward Hezron had relations with the daughter of Machir the father of Gilead—he had married her when he was 60 years old—and she bore him Segub. 
2:22 Segub fathered Jair, who had 23 cities in the land of Gilead. 
2:23 But Geshur and Aram took the towns of Jair from them, along with Kenath and its surrounding villages, 60 towns. All these were the sons of Machir the father of Gilead. 
2:24 After the death of Hezron in Caleb-ephrath, Abijah, Hezron’s wife, bore him Ashhur the father of Tekoa. 
2:25 Now the sons of Jerahmeel, the firstborn of Hezron: Ram the firstborn, then Bunah, Oren, Ozem and Ahijah. 
2:26 Jerahmeel had another wife whose name was Atarah; she was the mother of Onam. 
2:27 The sons of Ram, the firstborn of Jerahmeel: Maaz, Jamin and Eker. 
2:28 The sons of Onam: Shammai and Jada. The sons of Shammai: Nadab and Abishur. 
2:29 The name of the wife of Abishur was Abihail, and she bore him Ahban and Molid.

2:32 The sons of Jada the brother of Shammai: Jeter and Jonathan—Jeter died without sons.

2:34 Now Sheshan had no sons, only daughters. But Sheshan had a servant, an Egyptian, whose name was Jarha.

2:54 The sons of Salma: Beth-lehem, the Netophathites, Atroth-beth-joab, half the Manahathites, the Zorites, 
2:55 and the clans of scribes who lived at Jabez: the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, and the Sucathites. These were the Kenites who descended from Hammath, the father of the Rechabites.

3:4 Six were born to him in Hebron. There he reigned seven years and six months; then in Jerusalem he reigned 33 years. 
3:5 These were born to him in Jerusalem: Shimea, Shobab, Nathan and Solomon. These four were from Bath-shua the daughter of Ammiel; 
3:6 and the other nine were Ibhar, Elishama, Eliphelet, 
3:7 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
3:8 Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet.

4:3 These were the sons of Etam: Jezreel, Ishma and Idbash. The name of their sister was Hazlelponi. 
4:4 Penuel was the father of Gedor, and Ezer the father of Hushah. These were the descendants of Hur the firstborn of Ephrathah, the father of Beth-lehem. 
4:5 Ashhur, the father of Tekoa, had two wives, Helah and Naarah. 
4:6 Naarah bore him Ahuzam, Hepher, Timeni and Ahashtari. These were the sons of Naarah. 
4:7 The sons of Helah: Zereth, Zohar and Ethnan. 
4:8 Koz fathered Anub and Zobebah, and the families of Aharhel, the son of Harum.
4:9 Now Jabez was more honorable than his brothers. His mother named him Jabez saying, “Because I bore him with pain.” 
4:10 Jabez called out to the God of Israel, saying, “If only You would greatly bless me, and enlarge my territory. Let Your hand be with me and keep me from harm so that I might not suffer pain.” </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
4:11 Chelub, the brother of Shuhah, fathered Mehir, who was the father of Eshton. 
4:12 Eshton fathered Beth-rapha, Paseah and Tehinnah the father of Ir-nahash. These were the men of Recah. 
4:13 The sons of Kenaz: Othniel and Seraiah. The sons of Othniel: Hatath

4:15 The sons of Caleb, son of Jephunneh: Iru, Elah and Naam. The son of Elah: Kenaz. 
4:16 The sons of Jehallelel: Ziph, Ziphah, Tiriah and Asarel. 
4:17 The sons of Ezrah: Jether, Mered, Epher and Jalon. She also bore Miriam, Shammai and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa. 
4:18 (His Judahite wife bore Jered the father of Gedor, Heber the father of Soho and Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah.) These were the sons of Bithiah, Pharaoh’s daughter whom Mered married. 
4:19 The sons of Hodiah’s wife, the sister of Naham: the father of Keilah the Garmite and Eshtemoa the Maacathite. 
4:20 The sons of Shimon: Amnon, Rinnah, Ben-hanan and Tilon. The sons of Ishi: Zoheth and Ben-zoheth. 
4:21 The sons of Shelah, son of Judah: Er the father of Lecah, Ladah the father of Mareshah, the families of the linen workers at Beth-ashbea, 
4:22 and Jokim, the men of Cozeba, and Joash and Saraph, who had dominion in Moab and Jashubi-lehem (the records are ancient). 
4:23 These were the potters and those who lived in Netaim and Gederah; they lived there while doing the king’s work.
4:24 The sons of Simeon: Nemuel, Jamim, Jarib, Zerah, Shaul, 
4:25 his son Shallum, his son Mibsam, and his son Mishma. 
4:26 The descendants of Mishma: Hammuel, Zaccur his son and Shimei his son. 
4:27 Now Shimei had 16 sons and six daughters. But his brothers did not have many sons, so their family did not become as numerous as the sons of Judah. 
4:28 They dwelt in Beer-sheba, Moladah, Hazar-shual, 
4:29 Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad, 
4:30 Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag, 
4:31 Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susim, Beth-biri and Shaaraim. These were their towns until the reign of David, 
4:32 together with their villages, Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Tochen and Ashan—five in all, 
4:33 along with all the villages that surrounded these towns as far as Baal. These were their habitations. Registered in their genealogical records were: 
4:34 Meshobab, Jamlech, Joshah the son of Amaziah, 
4:35 Joel, Jehu son of Joshibiah, son of Seraiah, son of Asiel, 
4:36 Elioenai, Jaakobah, Jeshoaiah, Asaiah, Adiel, Jesimiel, Benaiah, 
4:37 and Ziza son of Shiphi, son of Allon, son of Jedaiah, son of Shimri, son of Shemaiah—
4:38 these mentioned by name were leaders in their families, and their clans increased greatly. 
4:39 Now they went to the entrance of Gedor, to the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks. 
4:40 They found rich and good pasture, and the land was spacious, quiet, and peaceful. The former inhabitants were Hamites. 
4:41 Now those whose names are recorded came during the days of King Hezekiah of Judah. They attacked the encampments of the Hamites, as well as the Meunim who were found there, and utterly wiped them out to this very day. They settled in their place because there was pasture there for their flocks. 
4:42 About 500 of them from the descendants of Simeon, led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi, went to Mount Seir 
4:43 where they struck down the remaining Amalekites who had escaped, and they live there to this day.
5:1 The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel—he was the firstborn, but when he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel—so he is not reckoned as the firstborn in the genealogical record. 
5:2 Though Judah was the strongest among his brothers, and a ruler came from him, the birthright belonged to Joseph. 
5:3 The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Enoch, Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. 
5:4 The descendants of Joel: his son Shemaiah, his son Gog, his son Shimei, 
5:5 his son Micah, his son Reaiah, his son Baal 
5:6 and his son Beerah whom Tillegath-pilneser king of Assyria carried into exile. He was the leader of the Reubenites. 
5:7 His kinsmen by their families, as listed in their genealogical records: the leader Jeiel, Zechariah, 
5:8 and Bela son of Azaz, son of Shema, son of Joel. They settled in Aroer as far as Nebo and Baal-meon, 
5:9 while in the east they settled as far as the entrance of the wilderness from this side of the river Euphrates, because their cattle had multiplied in the land of Gilead. 
5:10 Now in the days of Saul they had made war with the Hagrites, who fell by their hand. So they lived in their encampments in the entire eastern area of Gilead. 
5:11 Now the sons of Gad lived opposite them in the land of Bashan as far as Salcah: 
5:12 Joel the leader, Shapham second, then Janai and Shaphat in Bashan. 
5:13 Their kinsmen according to their ancestral families: Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jacan, Zia and Eber—seven in all. 
5:14 These were the sons of Abihail son of Huri, son of Jaroah, son of Gilead, son of Michael, son of Jehishai, son of Jahdo, son of Buz. 
5:15 Ahi son of Abdiel, son of Guni was leader of their ancestral families. 
5:16 They lived in Gilead, in Bashan and its surrounding villages, and in all the pasturelands of Sharon, up to their borders. 
5:17 All these were recorded by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel. 
5:18 The sons of Reuben and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh had 44,760 warriors ready for war—men who carried shield and sword and drew the bow, and were skilled in battle. 
5:19 So they made war with the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish and Nodab. 
5:20 They received help against them, so that the Hagrites and all who were with them were delivered into their hand, for they cried out to God during the battle. He answered their supplications, because they put their trust in Him. 
5:21 They took away their livestock: 50,000 of their camels, 250,000 sheep, and 2,000 donkeys, as well as 100,000 people. 
5:22 For many fell slain, because the war was of God. So they dwelt in their place until the exile.
5:23 Now the children of the half-tribe of Manasseh settled in the land from Bashan to Baal-hermon, Senir and Mount Hermon. They were numerous. 
5:24 These were the heads of their clans: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, Jahdiel. They were mighty men of valor, famous men, heads of their clans. 
5:25 But they were unfaithful to the God of their fathers, and prostituted themselves to the gods of the peoples of the land whom God had destroyed before them. 
5:26 So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of King Pul of Assyria—the spirit of Tillegath-pilneser king of Assyria—and he carried away the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara and to the river of Gozan, to this day.
6:1 The sons of Levi: Gershom, Kohath and Merari. 
6:2 These are the names of the sons of Gershom: Libni and Shimei. 
6:3 The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. 
6:4 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their clans.

6:11 his son Elkanah, Zophai his son, Nahath his son, 
6:12  Eliab his son, Jeroham his son, Elkanah his son. 
6:13 The sons of Samuel: his first-born Vashni, then Abiah. 
6:14 The sons of Merari: Mahli, Libni his son, Shimei his son, Uzzah his son, 
6:15 Shimea his son, Haggiah his son, Asaiah his son. 
6:16 Now these are the men David appointed to be in charge of the singing in the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:17 They ministered with song in front of the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting, until Solomon built the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
6:18 These are the ones who took their station, with their sons. Of the sons of the Kohathites: Heman the singer, son of Joel, son of Samuel, 
6:19 son of Elkanah, son of Jeroham, son of Eliel, son of Toah, 
6:20 son of Zuph, son of Elkanah, son of Mahath, son of Amasai, 
6:21 son of Elkanah, son of Joel, son of Azariah, son of Zephaniah, 
6:22 son of Tahath, son of Assir, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah, 
6:23 son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, son of Israel. 
6:24 His kinsman Asaph stood on his right—Asaph son of Berechiah, son of Shimea, 
6:25 son of Michael, son of Baaseiah, son of Malchijah, 
6:26 son of Ethni, son of Zerah, son of Adaiah, 
6:27 son of Ethan, son of Zimmah, son of Shimei, 
6:28 son of Jahath, son of Gershom, son of Levi. 
6:29 On the left hand their kinsmen the sons of Merari: Ethan son of Kishi, son of Abdi, son of Malluch, 
6:30 son of Hashabiah, son of Amaziah, son of Hilkiah, 
6:31 son of Amzi, son of Bani, son of Shemer, 
6:32 son of Mahli, son of Mushi, son of Merari, son of Levi. 
6:33 Their fellow Levites were appointed for all the avodah of the tabernacle of the House of God. 
6:34 But Aaron and his sons were the ones presenting offerings on the altar of burnt offering and on the altar of incense, for all the service of the Holy of Holies and to make atonement for Israel, according to all that Moses the servant of God had commanded. 
6:35 Now these are the sons of Aaron: Eleazar his son, Phineas his son, Abishua his son, 
6:36 Bukki his son, Uzzi his son, Zerahiah his son, 
6:37 Meraioth his son, Amariah his son, Ahitub his son, 
6:38 Zadok his son, Ahimaaz his son.
6:39 Now these are their dwelling places according to their encampments in their territories. To Aaron’s sons of the Kohathite families (for theirs was the first lot), 
6:40 to them they assigned Hebron in the land of Judah, and the open land around it; 
6:41 but the fields of the city and the villages, they gave to Caleb son of Jephunneh. 
6:42 To sons of Aaron they gave the cities of refuge: Hebron, also Libnah with its open land, Jattir, Eshtemoa with its open land, 
6:43 Hilen with its open land, Debir with its open land, 
6:44 Ashan with its open land, and Beth-shemesh with its open land. 
6:45 From the tribe of Benjamin: Geba with its open land, and Alemeth with its open land, and Anathoth with its open land. They had 13 cities in all among their families. 
6:46 To the rest of the sons of Kohath ten cities were assigned by lot from the family of the half-tribe of Manasseh.
6:47 To the sons of Gershom, according to their families, 13 cities were assigned from the tribe of Issachar, from the tribe of Asher, from tribe of Naphtali and from the tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
6:48 To the sons of Merari 12 cities were assigned by lot, according to their families, from the tribe of Reuben, from the tribe of Gad and from the tribe of Zebulun. 
6:49 So </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Bnei-Yisrael
6:50 They also assigned by lot from the tribe of the children of Judah, from the tribe of the children of Simeon, and from the tribe of the children of Benjamin, these cities that were mentioned by name.

9:21 Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper of the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
9:22 All these chosen to be gatekeepers at the gates were 212. These were registered in the genealogical records of their villages. David and Samuel the seer had appointed them to their offices. 
9:23 They and their sons were guards of the gates of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
9:24 The gatekeepers were posted on the four sides, toward the east, west, north, and south. 
9:25 Their kinsmen in their villages were to come from time to time and serve with them for seven days. 
9:26 For the four chief gatekeepers, who were Levites, were entrusted over the chambers and over the treasuries in the House of God. 
9:27 They would spend the night around the House of God, because they were assigned to guard it and were in charge of opening it morning by morning.

9:29 Some of them were appointed over the equipment and over all the utensils of the sanctuary, as well as over the fine flour, the wine, the oil, the frankincense and the spices.

9:31 Mattithiah, one of the Levites, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was in charge of preparing the flat cakes. 
9:32 Some of the relatives of Kohathites were in charge of preparing the rows of bread every Shabbat. 
9:33 Now these were the singers, patriarchal leaders of the Levites, who stayed in the chambers and were exempt from other service, for they were on duty day and night. 
9:34 These were heads of the Levite families, chiefs in their geneaological records. These lived in Jerusalem. 
9:35 Jeiel, the father of Gibeon, lived in Gibeon. His wife’s name was Maacah.

10:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel. The men of Israel fled before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. 
10:2 The Philistines pursued Saul and his sons. The Philistines killed Saul’s sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malchi-shua. 
10:3 The battle raged around Saul and the archers spotted him and he was wounded by the archers. 
10:4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through, so that these uncircumcised will not come and torture me.” But his armor-bearer refused to do it, because he was terrified. Therefore Saul took the sword and fell on it. 
10:5 When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died. 
10:6 So Saul and his three sons died; his whole household died together. 
10:7 Now when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their towns and fled. The Philistines then came and lived in them. 
10:8 The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
10:9 They stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines proclaiming the good news to their idols and to the people. 
10:10 They put his armor in the house of their gods, and hung his head in the house of Dagon. 
10:11 Now when all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
10:12 all the valiant men arose and retrieved the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to Jabesh. They buried their bones under the oak tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. 
10:13 So Saul died because of his unfaithful acts that he committed against the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

11:1 Then all Israel gathered to David at Hebron, saying: “Behold, we are your own flesh and blood. 
11:2 In the past, even when Saul was king, you were the one that led out and brought in Israel. </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:3 When all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, David made a covenant with them in Hebron before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:4 Then David and all Israel went to Jerusalem—that is Jebus, where the Jebusite inhabitants of the land lived. 
11:5 Now the residents of Jebus said to David, “You cannot get in here!” Nevertheless David captured the stronghold of Zion, which is now the city of David. 
11:6 David had said, “Whoever strikes down the Jebusites first will be commander-in-chief.” So Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became commander. 
11:7 David lived in the stronghold; for this reason it is called the city of David. 
11:8 He fortified the city all around, from the Millo to the surrounding walls, and Joab repaired the rest of the city. 
11:9 David grew more and more powerful because </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:10 Now these were chiefs of David’s mighty men, who strongly supported him in his kingdom, together with all Israel to make him king, according to the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:11 This is the list of David’s mighty men: Jashobeam the son of Hachmoni, was the chief of the 30; he wielded his spear against 300 and slew them all at one time. 
11:12 After him was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men. 
11:13 He was with David at Pas Dammim, when the Philistines assembled there for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley where the army retreated from before the Philistines, 
11:14 but they took a stand in the middle of the plot; they defended it and struck down the Philistines. </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:15 Three of the 30 leaders went down to David at the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a band of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 
11:16 At that time, David was in the stronghold, while the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem. 
11:17 David had a craving and said, “If only someone would give me water to drink from the cistern by the gate in Bethlehem!” 
11:18 So the three broke through the Philistine camp and drew water from the cistern by the gate in Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But David refused to drink it. He poured it out to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
11:19 and said: “Far be it for me that I should do this before my God! Can I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?”—for they brought it at the risk of their lives and he would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the Three mighty men. 
11:20 Abishai, Joab’s brother, was chief of the Three. He once wielded his spear against 300 and slew them. Thus he won a name among the Three. 
11:21 Of the Three, he was more highly esteemed than the other two and became their commander, even though he was not one of the three. 
11:22 Beniah son of Jehoiada was a valiant man from Kabzeel who had done mighty deeds. He killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab, and went down and killed a lion inside a pit on a snowy day.
11:23 He also killed the giant Egyptian man who was five cubits tall. In his hand the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver’s beam, yet Beniah attacked him with a club. He snatched the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear. 
11:24 These were the exploits of Beniah son of Jehoiada, who gained renown among the three mighty men. 
11:25 Behold, he was more honorable than the 30, yet he was not one of the Three. Nevertheless, David set him over his bodyguard. 
11:26 The mighty men were: Asael Joab’s brother, Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem, 
11:27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, 
11:28 Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,

11:40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
11:41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad son of Ahlai, 
11:42 Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and 30 with him, 
11:43 Hanan son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite, 
11:44 Uzzijah the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel sons of Hotam the Aroerite, 
11:45 Jedaiael son of Shimri and Joha his brother the Tizite, 
11:46 Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah, sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite; 
11:47 Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite. 
12:1 Now these are the men who came to David at Ziklag when he was banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish. They were among the warriors who assisted him in battle. 
12:2 They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left to sling stones and shoot arrows from the bow. They were Saul’s kinsmen from Benjamin. 
12:3 Their chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite, Jeziel and Pelet, sons of Azmaveth, and Beracah, Jehu the Anathothite, 
12:4  Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the 30 and leading the 30,

12:6 Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Hariphite, 
12:7 Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer and Jashobeam, the Korahites, 
12:8 Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham from Gedor. 
12:9 Some of the Gadites there withdrew to follow David to the stronghold in the wilderness. They were valiant men trained for battle, armed with shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions and were as swift as the gazelles on the mountains.
12:10 Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 
12:11 Mish</span><span class="it"><span class="content">manna
12:12 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, 
12:13 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 
12:14 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh. 
12:15 These were the Gadites, leaders of the army. The least was equal to 100 and the greatest to 1,000. 
12:16 These were the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it was overflowing its banks, routing all those in the valleys to the east and to the west. 
12:17 Some of the children of Benjamin and also from Judah came to David at the stronghold. 
12:18 David went out to meet them and answered them saying, “If you come to me in peace to support me, then my heart will be united with you. But if it is to betray me to my adversaries, when my hands have done no wrong, then may the God of our fathers take notice and judge.” 
12:19 Then a spirit came upon Amasai, leader of the 30, “We are yours, David, on your side, son of Jesse. </span><span class="it"><span class="content">Shalom
12:20 Some from Manasseh went over to David when he went with the Philistines to battle against Saul. But they did not help them because the Philistine rulers after consultation sent him away, saying: “It would cost us our heads if he defected to his master Saul.” 
12:21 When he went to Ziklag, these from Manasseh joined him—Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, Zillethai, the leaders of thousands that were from Manasseh. 
12:22 They helped David against the raiding bands, for all of them were valiant warriors and they were officers in the army. 
12:23 Day by day men came to David to help him until there was a great army like the army of God. 
12:24 These are the numbers of the heads of those armed for war who came to David in Hebron to transfer Saul’s kingdom to him, according to the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

12:33 from the sons of Issachar—men who know how to interpret the signs of the times to determine what Israel should do—200 chiefs with all their kinsmen under their command; 
12:34 from Zebulun 50,000 warriors prepared for battle, arrayed with all types of weapons of war and ready to give their undivided loyalty; 
12:35 from Naphtali 1,000 officers, along with 37,000 with shield and spear; 
12:36 from the Danites, 28,600 equipped for battle; 
12:37 from Asher 40,000 experienced warriors arrayed for battle; 
12:38 and from beyond the Jordan, from the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh 120,000 armed with every type of weapons of war. 
12:39 All these fighting men, prepared for the battle line, came to Hebron with a whole heart to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of Israel were also of one heart to make David king. 
12:40 So they were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their kinsmen had given them provision. 
13:1 Then David consulted with the officers of the thousands and of the hundreds, with every leader. 
13:2 David said to the entire assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and is from </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:3 Let us bring the Ark of our God back to us—for we did not inquire of it in the days of Saul.” 
13:4 The entire assembly agreed to do so, for the proposal seemed right in the eyes of all the people. 
13:5 So David assembled all Israel from the Shihor of Egypt to the entrance of Hamat, to bring the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. 
13:6 David and all Israel went up to Baalah, to Kiriath-jearim, that was in Judah to bring up from there the Ark of God, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:7 They transported the Ark of God upon a new cart from the house of Abinadab. Uzza and Ahio guided the cart 
13:8 while David and all Israel celebrated before God with all their might, with songs, lyres, harps, timbrels, cymbals and trumpets. 
13:9 But when they came to the threshing-floor of Hidon, Uzza reached out his hand to hold the Ark, because the oxen stumbled. 
13:10 The anger of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:11 David was angry because </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
13:12 David feared God that day, saying, “How can I ever bring the Ark of God to me?” 
13:13 So David did not take the Ark with him to the City of David, but left it in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 
13:14 So the Ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months; </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:1 Now King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, as well as cedar logs, stonemasons and carpenters, to build a palace for him. 
14:2 Then David knew that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:3 David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David fathered more sons and daughters. 
14:4 These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
14:5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
14:6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
14:7 Elishama, Beeliada and Eliphelet.
14:8 When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up in search of David, but David heard of it and went out before them. 
14:9 Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim. 
14:10 So David inquired of God, asking, “Should I go up against the Philistines? Will You give them over into my hand?” Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
14:11 So they came up to Baal-perazim, where David defeated them. David said, “God burst out against my enemies by my hand, like waters burst out!” Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim . 
14:12 They abandoned their gods there, so David ordered and they were burned with fire. 
14:13 But the Philistines again raided the valley. 
14:14 So David again inquired of God, and God said to him, “Do not go up after them, but circle around behind them and come against them in front of the baca trees . 
14:15 As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the baca trees, then go out to battle. For God has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.” 
14:16 David did just as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer. 
14:17 So the fame of David spread throughout every land, and </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:1 David built houses made for himself in the City of David; he then prepared a place for the Ark of God and pitched a tent for it. 
15:2 Then David said, “No one should carry the Ark of God except the Levites, for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:3 David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring the Ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:4 David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites: 
15:5 from the sons of Kohath: Uriel the leader and 120 of his kinsmen; 
15:6 from the sons of Merari: Asaiah the leader and 220 0f his kinsmen; 
15:7 from the sons of Gershom: Joel the leader with 130 of his kinsmen; 
15:8 from the sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the leader with 200 of his kinsmen; 
15:9 from the sons of Hebron: Eliel the leader with 80 of his kinsmen; 
15:10 from the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the leader and 112 of his kinsmen. 
15:11 David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
15:12 He told them, “You are the heads of the Levitical families. Sanctify yourselves, you and your kinsmen, so that you may bring up the Ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:13 Because you were not there the first time, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:14 So the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
15:15 The Levites carried the Ark of God on their shoulders with poles, just as Moses commanded according to the word of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:16 David ordered the leaders of the Levites to appoint their kinsmen, the singers, with musical instruments, harps, lyres, and cymbals, to joyfully make their voices heard. 
15:17 So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his brothers, Asaph son of Berechiah; from their brothers the descendants of Merari, Ethan son of Kushaiah; 
15:18 and with them their relatives second in rank: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphalehu and Mikneiahu, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel. 
15:19 The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals; 
15:20 Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoh, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah and Benaiah were to play harps according to alamoth , 
15:21 but Mattitiah, Eliphalehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jehiel and Azaziah were to lead with lyres, according to the sheminith . 
15:22 Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in music, was to direct the music because he was a master. 
15:23 Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the Ark. 
15:24 The </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
15:25 So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of the thousands went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:26 Because God helped the Levites who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:27 Now David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the Ark, and as were the singers and Henaniah the leader of the songs of the singers. David also wore a linen ephod. 
15:28 Thus all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
15:29 As the Ark of the Covenant of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:1 They brought the Ark of God and set it in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it. Then they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God. 
16:2 After David finished offering the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the Name of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:3 He then distributed to everyone in Israel—man and woman alike—to each a loaf of bread, a date cake and a raisin cake. 
16:4 He appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the Ark of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:5 Asaph was the chief and second to him were Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom and Jehiel. They were to play harps and lyres; Asaph was to sound the cymbals, 
16:6 and the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
16:7 On that day David first appointed Asaph and his kinsmen to give thanks to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:8 Give thanks to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:9 Sing to Him! Sing praises to Him! Tell of all His wonderful acts.

16:14 He is </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:15 Remember His covenant forever, the word that He commanded for a thousand generations— 
16:16 that He made with Abraham, swore to Isaac, 
16:17 and confirmed in a decree with Jacob to Israel as an everlasting covenant, 
16:18 saying: “To you I give the land of Canaan as your allotted inheritance.” 
16:19 When you were but a few in number, very few, and strangers in it, 
16:20 and wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another, 
16:21 He allowed no one to oppress them, but for their sake He reproved kings: 
16:22 “Touch not My anointed ones, and do My prophets no harm.” 
16:23 Sing to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:24 Declare His glory among the nations, His wonderous works among all the peoples. 
16:25 For great is </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:26 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

16:32 Let the sea roar and all that is in it. Let the field rejoice and all that is in it.

16:35 Declare, “Save us, O God of our salvation! Gather and rescue us from the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy Name, that we may glory in Your praise.” 
16:36 Blessed be </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:37 So David left Asaph and his kinsmen there before the Ark of the Covenant of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:38 including Obed-edom and his 68 kinsmen. Obed-edom son of Jeduthun and Hosah were gatekeepers. 
16:39 Also he left Zadok the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohen
16:40 to offer burnt offerings to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:41 Along with them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest who were chosen, designated by name to give thanks to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
16:42 Heman and Jeduthun had trumpets and cymbals for music and other instruments for praising God. The sons of Jeduthun were to be at the gate. 
16:43 Then all the people departed each one to his home, and David returned to bless his household.
17:1 After David settled in his place, David said to Nathan the prophet, “Look! I am living in a house of cedar, while the Ark of the Covenant of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:2 Then Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.” 
17:3 But that same night the word of God came to Nathan, saying: 
17:4 “Go and tell David My servant, thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:5 For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel out to this day. I have gone from tent to tent, and from one dwelling to another. 
17:6 Wherever I went throughout all Israel, did I ever speak a word to any of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, “Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?”’ 
17:7 “So now, say this to My servant David, ‘Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:8 I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make your name like the names of the great ones that are in the earth. 
17:9 I wil establish a place for My people Israel, and plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place and shall tremble no more. Violent people will no longer wear them down, as they did formerly, 
17:10 from the days I ordered judges to be over My people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies.’ “‘Moreover, I declare to you that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:11 It will be that when your days are fulfilled to go with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. 
17:12 He will build a house for Me and I will establish his throne forever. 
17:13 I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me, I will not withdraw My lovingkindness from him, as I withdrew it from the one who ruled before you. 
17:14 I will appoint him over My House and My kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.’” 
17:15 According to all these words and according to all this vision, Nathan spoke to David. 
17:16 Then King David went in and sat before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:17 And this was not enough in Your eyes, O God! You have spoken about the future of Your servant’s household. You have regarded me as the most distinquished of men, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:18 “What more can David say to You for honoring Your servant? For You know Your servant. 
17:19 , for the sake of Your servant and according to Your own heart, You have done all these great things, to reveal all Your greatness. 
17:20 “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:21 And who is like Your people Israel—the one nation on earth whom God went out to redeem as a people for Himself and to make a Name for Yourself by great and awesome deeds, by driving out nations from before Your people, whom You redeemed from Egypt? 
17:22 You made Your people Israel Your own people forever, and You, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
17:23 “Now, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

17:27 Now You are willing to bless the house of Your servant, so that it may continue forever before You, for it is You, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:1 In the course of time, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them. He took Gath and its villages from the hand of the Philistines. 
18:2 He also defeated Moab, and the Moabites became vassals to David and brought tribute. 
18:3 Moreover, David defeated King Hadadezer of Zobah at Hamath, when he went to establish his dominion to the Euphrates River. 
18:4 David captured from him 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen and 20,000 infantrymen. David hamstrung all the chariot horses but reserved 100 of them for chariots. 
18:5 When the Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down 22,000 of the Arameans. 
18:6 David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus and the Arameans became subject to David and brought tribute. </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:7 David took the gold shields that were on Hadadezer’s servants and brought them to Jerusalem. 
18:8 From Tibhath and from Kun, Hadadezer’s cities, David took a very large quantity of bronze, which Solomon used to make the bronze sea, pillars and bronze vessels. 
18:9 When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of King Hadadezer of Zobah, 
18:10 he sent his son Hadoram to King David to greet and bless him because he fought against Hadarezer and defeated him—for Hadadezer had many wars with Tou. He also sent all kinds of articles of gold, silver and bronze. 
18:11 King David dedicated these articles to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:12 Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 
18:13 Then he put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became vassals to David. So </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
18:14 David reigned over all Israel and he administered justice and righteousness to all his people. 
18:15 Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was secretary. 
18:16 Zadok son of Ahitub and Abimelech son of Abiathar were </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
18:17 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and Pelethites, and David’s sons were chief officials in the service of the king.
19:1 Now in the course of time Nachash king of the Ammonites died and his son became king in his place. 
19:2 David said: “l will show lovingkindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father dealt loyally with me.” So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. But when David’s emissaries came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to console him, 
19:3 the Ammonite officials said to Hanun, “Do you really think that David is honoring your father, by sending messengers to express sympathy? Have not his servants come to you to explore and spy out the country to overthrow it?” 
19:4 So Hanun took David’s emissaries and shaved them. He cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks and sent them away. 
19:5 When some people came and told David about the men, he sent messengers to meet them for the men were throughly humiliated. The king said: “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow and then return.” 
19:6 When the children of Ammon realized they had made themselves a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram-naharaim , Aram-maacah and Zobah. 
19:7 So they hired 32,000 chariots along with the king of Maacah and his people, who came and camped before Medeba. The children of Ammon also assembled from their cities and moved out to the battle. 
19:8 On hearing this, David sent Joab and the entire army of mighty men. 
19:9 The children of Ammon came out and took up battle formation at the city gate, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the field. 
19:10 When Joab saw that there was a battle line against him both in front and rear, he selected some of Israel’s best men and deployed them against the Arameans. 
19:11 He put the rest of the people under the command of his brother Abishai, and arrayed them against the Ammonites. 
19:12 He said: “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you will help me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you. 
19:13  will do what is good in His eyes.” 
19:14 So Joab and the people who were with him advanced to battle against the Arameans, and they fled before him. 
19:15 When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they likewise fled before his brother Abishai and withdrew into the city. Then Joab went to Jerusalem. 
19:16 After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they sent messengers and had the Arameans brought from across the River with Shophah the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them. 
19:17 When David was informed he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan. He came against them and took up positions against them. David took up positions against the Arameans in battle and they fought with him. 
19:18 But the Arameans fled before Israel. David killed 7,000 Aramean charioteers and 40,000 infantrymen. He also killed Shophah the commander of the army. 
19:19 Now when Hadadezer’s vassals saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and served him. Thus the Arameans were no longer willing to help the Ammonites. 
20:1 At the turn of the year, the season when kings go out to war, Joab led out the army and devastated the land of the Ammonites. He went and besieged Rabbah, while David remained in Jerusalem. Joab smote Rabbah and left it in ruins. 
20:2 David took the crown from the head of their king—its weight was found to be a talent of gold and it was set with precious stones—and it was placed on David’s head. He took a vast amount of spoils from the city. 
20:3 Furthermore, he removed the people who were in it and set them to work with saws, sharp iron tools and axes. Thus he did to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. 
20:4 Now it came about after this, that war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaim, and they were subdued. 
20:5 Again there was war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear had a shaft like a weaver’s beam. 
20:6 Once again there was a battle at Gath, where there was a man of great stature who had 24 fingers and toes, six on each hand and six on each foot. He too also descended from the giants. 
20:7 When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David’s brother, struck him down. 
20:8 These were descendants of the giants in Gath; they fell by the hand of David and his servants. 
21:1 Then satan stood up against Israel and incited David to count Israel. 
21:2 So David told Joab and the leaders of the people, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba to Dan. Then bring me a report so I may know their number.” 
21:3 But Joab said, “May </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:4 Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and finally came back to Jerusalem. 
21:5 Joab gave the number of the census of the people to David: in all Israel there were 1,100,000 sword-wielding men; Judah had 470,000 sword-wielding men. 
21:6 But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king’s word was detestable to Joab. 
21:7 But God was displeased with this thing and He struck Israel. 
21:8 Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly by doing this. But now, I entreat you, take away the guilt of Your servant for I have behaved very foolishly.” 
21:9 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:10 “Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:11 So Gad went to David and said to him, “Thus says </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:12 either three years of famine, or three months being swept away from before your adversaries and the sword of your enemies overtaking you or three days of the sword of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:13 David said to Gad, “I am in a great anguish! Let me fall into the hand of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:14 So </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:15 And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but while he was doing so, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:16 David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:17 David said to God, “Was it not I who commanded to count the people? I alone am the one who sinned and behaved wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let Your hand, </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:18 So the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:19 So David went up by the word of Gad, which he spoke in the Name of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:20 While Ornan was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel. His four sons who were with him hid themselves. 
21:21 When David came to Ornan, Ornan looked up and saw David. He went out from the threshing floor and bowed to David with his face to the ground. 
21:22 Then David said to Ornan: “Give me the site of this threshing floor that I may build an altar to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:23 Then Ornan said to David, “Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever seems good in his eyes. Look, I will give the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this.” 
21:24 King David said to Ornan, “No, I insist on buying it for the full price. For I will not take for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:25 So David gave Ornan 600 shekels of gold by weight for the place. 
21:26 David built there an altar to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:27 Then </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:28 At that time, when David saw that </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:29 For the Tabernacle of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
21:30 But David could not go before it to seek God for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:1 Then David said, “This is the place where the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:2 David gave orders to assemble the foreigners in the land of Israel, and assigned them to be masons to quarry stones to build the House of God. 
22:3 David supplied an abundance of iron for nails for the doors of the gates and for the joints, so much bronze that it could not be weighed, 
22:4 and cedar logs without number, for the Zidonians and the Tyrians brought an abundance of cedar logs to David. 
22:5 David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced and the House that is to be built for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:6 Then He called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a House for </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
22:7 David said to Solomon, “My son, I had it in my heart to build a House for the name of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

22:17 David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son,

22:19 Now set your hearts and souls to seek after </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:1 When David was old and full of days, he made his son Solomon king over Israel. 
23:2 He also gathered together all the leaders of Israel along with the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
23:3 The Levites 30 years old or more were counted; their head count was 38,000 men. 
23:4 Of these, there were 24,000 to oversee the work of the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:5  4,000 gatekeepers, and 4,000 for praising </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:6 David organized them into divisions: The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. 
23:7 Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei. 
23:8 The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the leader, Zetham and Joel—three. 
23:9 The sons of Shimei: Shelomith, Haziel and Haran—three. These were the heads of the clans of Ladan. 
23:10 The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush and Beriah. These were the sons of Shimei—four. 
23:11 Jahath was the first and Zizah the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were enrolled together as a single clan. 
23:12 The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel—four. 
23:13 The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron, along with his descendants, was set apart to be consecrated as most holy forever, to burn incense before </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:14 But as for Moses the man of God, his sons are named among the tribe of Levi. 
23:15 The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. 
23:16 The sons of Gershom: Shebuel, the leader. 
23:17 The sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah the chief. Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous. 
23:18 The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the leader. 
23:19 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth. 
23:20 The sons of Uzziel: Micah the first and Isshiah the second. 
23:21 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish. 
23:22 Eleazar died having no sons but only daughters; the sons of Kish, their kinsmen, took them as wives. 
23:23 The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Yeremot—three. 
23:24 These were the sons of Levi by clans, with the heads of clans as they were enrolled and with a list of their names by heads who carried out the task of avodah in the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:25 For David said: “</span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:26 Therefore, the Levites need not carry the Tabernacle and all the vessels for avodah.” 
23:27 For according to David’s final instructions, the Levites 20 years old and upward were counted. 
23:28 For their duty was to help the descendants of Aaron in the avodah of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:29 the rows of bread, the fine flour for the grain offering, the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">matzot

23:31 and whenever burnt offerings were offered to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
23:32 They were to keep watch over the Tent of Meeting, the Holy Place and the sons of Aaron their kinsmen for avodah in the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:1 Now these were the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron were Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
24:2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no children, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
24:3 David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them into their offices according to their avodah. 
24:4 More leading men were found among the sons of Eleazar than among the sons of Ithamar, so they divided them: the sons of Eleazar had 16 leaders of clans and the sons of Ithamar had eight leaders of clans. 
24:5 Thus, they were impartially divided by lot for there were officials of the Holy Place and officials of God, both from the sons of Eleazar and from the sons of Ithamar. 
24:6 The scribe Shemaiah, son of Nethanel from the Levites, recorded them in the presence of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the leaders of the clans of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
24:7 Now the first lot came for Jehoiarib, the second for Jedaiah,

24:17 the twentyfirst for Jachin, the twentysecond for Gamul, 
24:18 the twentythird for Delaiah, the twentyfourth for Maaziah. 
24:19 These were their duties for their avodah upon entering into the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
24:20 As for the rest of the sons of Levi: from the sons of Amram: Shubael; from the sons of Shubael: Jehdeiah. 
24:21 As for Rehabiah, from the sons of Rehabiah Isshiah was the first. 
24:22 From the Izharites: Shelomoth; from the sons of Shelomoth: Jahath. 
24:23 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.

24:28 From Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. 
24:29 From Kish, the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel. 
24:30 The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites by their clans. 
24:31 These also cast lots even as their kinsmen the sons of Aaron did in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech and the heads of the clans of the </span><span class="it"><span class="content">kohanim
25:1 Moreover, David and the commanders of the army, set apart for avodah the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun who prophesied with lyres, harps and cymbals. The list of those who performed this work according to their service was: 
25:2 from the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah. The sons of Asaph were under the supervision of Asaph, who prophesied under the hand of the king. 
25:3 As for Jeduthun, from Jeduthun’s sons: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Hashabiah and Mattithiah—six, under the charge of their father Jeduthun—who prophesied with the harp, giving thanks and praise to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

25:5 All these were the sons of Heman the king’s seer according to the promise of God to lift up a horn. God gave Heman 14 sons and three daughters. 
25:6 All these were under the direction of their father for singing in the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
25:7 with their kinsmen all trained and skillfull singers of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

26:5 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, and Peullethai the eighth, (for God had blessed him). 
26:6 To his son Shemaiah were born sons who were leaders of their clans, for they were men of great ability. 
26:7 The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed and Elzabad. His brothers Elihu and Semachiah were also valiant men. 
26:8 All these were descendants of Obed-edom. They and their sons and their kinsmen were capable men with the strength to do the work—62 of Obed-edom.

26:12 These divisions of the gatekeepers by their chief men had duties corresponding to their kinsmen for avodah in the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:13 So they cast lots, small and great alike, by clans for each gate. 
26:14 The lot for the east gate fell to Shelemiah. Then they cast lots for Zechariah his son, an insightful counselor, and his lot came out for the north gate. 
26:15 To Obed-edom the south gate and to his sons the storehouse. 
26:16 To Shuppim and Hosah the east gate by the Shallecheth gate on the ascending highway. Guard corresponded to guard.

26:18 At the colonnade on the west, there were four on the road and two at the colonnade itself.

26:20 And the Levites: Ahijah was over the treasuries of the House of God and the treasuries of the dedicated things. 
26:21 The descendants of Ladan who were sons of Gershon through Ladan and were chiefs of the clans of Ladan the Gershonite were Jehieli,

26:25 His relatives through Eliezer: Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zichri his son and Shelomith his son. 
26:26 This Shelomith and his kinsmen were over all the treasuries of the dedicated things that King David and the chiefs of the clans and the commanders over thousands and hundreds, and other army commanders had dedicated. 
26:27 They dedicated some of the plunder taken in battles to maintain the House of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
26:28 All that Samuel the seer, Saul son of Kish, Abner son of Ner and Joab son of Zeruiah had dedicated, and any other dedicated thing was in the care of Shelomith and his relatives.

26:32 His relatives, 2,700 men of valor, were heads of clans whom King David had appointed over the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of the Manasseh in every matter pertaining to God and the affairs of the king.

27:22 of Dan: Azarel son of Jeroham. These were the officers of the tribes of Israel. 
27:23 But David did not count those 20 years old and under, because </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
27:24 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to count them, but did not finish. Wrath came upon Israel for this and the number was not entered into the account in the chronicles of King David. 
27:25 Over the king’s storehouses: Azmaveth son of Adiel. Over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, in the villages and in the citadels: Jonathan son of Uzziah;

27:33 Ahithophel was the king’s counselor. Hushai the Arkite was the king’s friend. 
27:34 Ahithophel was succeeded by Jehoiada son of Benaiah and by Abiatar. Joab was the commander of the king’s army.

28:2 Then King David rose to his feet and said, “Listen to me, my brothers and my people! As for me, it was in my heart to build a resting place for the Ark of the Covenant of </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai

29:2 Now I have made every effort to prepare for the House of my God gold for the golden objects, silver for silver, copper for copper, iron for iron, and wood for wood; onyx stones and inlay stones, stones of antimony and varigated colors—every kind of precious stones and marble in abundance. 
29:3 Moreover, in my devotion to the House of my God, I have given over my private treasure of gold and silver to the House of my God, in addition to all that I have already supplied for the holy House: 
29:4  3,000 gold talents of gold from Ophir, and 7,000 talents of refined silver to overlay the walls of the houses—
29:5 gold for golden objects and silver for silver for all the work—into the hands of craftsmen. Who then will offer willingly, consecrating himself this day to </span><span class="it"><span class="sc"><span class="content">Adonai
29:6 Then the leaders of the clans, the officials of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and hundreds and the supervisors over the king’s work contributed willingly.
